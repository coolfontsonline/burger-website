                        <!-- PUT IMAGE HERE AMY -->
                        Last year, I wrote a comprehensive list of every game I had played in 2022. This is easy because
                        forgetting things is not my strong suit. I failed to publish that list, however. Let's try
                        again! No rules, Just my thoughts. It will be edited only- and exactly- ONCE. So please be
                        forgiving- the pictures will be (mostly) pretty!
                        <br><br>
                        Before I get going, here are the 3 indie games (and best games I played this year) you should
                        buy and play: (CLICK THESE LINKS)
                        <br><br>
                        BEFORE THE GREEN MOON: By Turnfollow (also steam link): The future of narrative expression in
                        Video Games
                        <br><br>
                        24 KILLERS: By Happy Shabby Games: A deep meditation on what it means to be Home.
                        <br><br>
                        VOID STRANGER: By System Erasure (also steam link)
                </p><h2>Death Stranding</h2><p> <!-- PUT IMAGE HERE AMY -->
                I actually really wanted to draw Mads' Character but I'd have to learn how to draw a gun
                No, drawing Norman Reedus was never in the cards for me this year
                <br><br>
                Subtlety is for cowards. I got this game free for Christmas and had gotten those sweet 8bitdo
                ultimate controllers, so the timing was fresh- I had somehow gone the last few years completely
                unspoiled on Death Stranding other than that "you eventually get ziplines." I love incremental
                games: Succubox, a dark room, Cityinc, games that let you sit with them as more parts of itself
                slowly untangle. An exercise in progression and personalized investment- a touching story about
                letting others in- choosing to believe it isn't the end of the world.
                <br><br>
                My god! What a game! You pick up things with the triggers, and you have to keep holding them
                down to continue to hold them!!! Hand management in a AAA game!!! This was made for me!!!!!
                <br><br>
                It's a game that understands the joys of going on a walk!!!
                <br><br>
                My best friend in the whole wide world was watching me infrequently, at first guffawing at the
                brashness and boldness of the cutscenes. Soon, we were at the plot reveal involving Mads
                Mikkelsen, only for them to tell me "okay yeah this all works." IT SURE DOES.
                <br><br>
                Also I'm going to be mean here for only once: If your smile lines didn't immediately crease at
                the suggestion that your main character's name is Sam Porter Bridges and is a deliveryman, who
                comes to help build bridges- that's your problem! Fix that problem!!!!!
                </p><h2>Elden Ring: Co-Op Mod</h2><p> <!-- PUT IMAGE HERE AMY -->
                Honestly wish more people loved my bloody doofus
                Kneel.
                <br><br>
                I had a lot of fun with Elden Ring in 2022, so I decided to play it with my best friend in the
                whole wide world. We had an absolute stupid idiot blast nearly the entire way through- until we
                didn't, at the exact point I knew we wouldn't (you probably know it too!!!!!!). We abandoned
                ship *literally* at Maliketh's door. It's a game that's exactly really really good for 80% of
                it.
                <br><br>
                I now feel confident enough to deliver my hot take: Mohg is straight up the best boss in the
                game. Cool secret weakness you have to go out to find? Check. Cool second other special defense
                for only his battle? Super Check. Just absolutely good phase allocation begging you to just keep
                trying until you get it? I wish they gave you a proper big dungeon, my literal blood brother:
                You deserved to be in that tree!
                <br><br>
                This was a proper 2 party RPG- please grab a friend and treat yourself to it soon. Even if it
                *is* a bit buggy at times.
                </p><h2>Doom Eternal</h2><p> <!-- PUT IMAGE HERE AMY -->
                Okay, they're fine. Leave me alone. They're not actually what's wrong with the game, but grant
                me this: they sure do look dumb!
                <br><br>
                I didn't like it!
                </p><h2>DOOM</h2><p> <!-- PUT IMAGE HERE AMY -->
                i'm just gonna say it: best lookin demon of the Doom demons right here
                Me, circa March 2023 playing DOOM
                <br><br>
                If I had played DOOM Instead of Half Life, my life would have turned out entirely different. I
                never thought a game could sell me on *not* having to aim vertically, but it turns out games can
                be WAY harder in an interesting way if you just let them aim up for you! I started to wonder if
                vertical aiming was a mistake! (it’s not.)
                <br><br>
                If I played Doom as a teenager, I would have immediately made some levels and become a 20x
                better a level designer than I am right now. Instead, I got addicted to design as functional
                place and opened up hammer editor once before I realized I needed to be 15 years older to
                understand literally anything.
                </p><h2>DOOM II</h2><p> <!-- PUT IMAGE HERE AMY -->
                Like seriously, go back an look at the revenant sprite: Is that a happy skeleton?
                Phonin’ it in
                <br><br>
                I didn't finish it- I will! I think a lot of it is fun! Some of it is strange, what a kinder
                memoir would call "bold and experimental"- I think it's fine! Some of those new enemies are
                great! Please keep in mind I like Ms. Pac Man more than Pac Man, so I'm not a purity enthusiast
                by any means, but it does feel like they added some kind of 5th ghost that did a Whole New
                Thing™ but also gave Ms. Pacman a piece.
                </p><h2>24 Killers</h2><p> <!-- PUT IMAGE HERE AMY -->
                There's so much character to the round way Home is drawn in game that I wish I was able to
                capture...the price of fidelity
                I think there’s something wonderful about your avatar being a hijacked, faceless corpse
                <br><br>
                I have a lot more to say about this game, but know this: I loved this game to its bones and let
                its rain wash me over. It is rare that a game can truly instill a sense of place bereft of
                external conflict. It's a bouqet of flowers blooming in a long dead corpse. The World is a dead
                thing- it's why you need to live in it.
                <br><br>
                You should play it. RIGHT NOW. Anyone can! Do it! Do it now! BUY IT.
                <br><br>
                Okay, if you really need more selling:
                <br><br>
                24 Killers is a game that is a lot like Moon: Remix RPG Adventure- it’s systems are familiar,
                but instead of (according to Moon) justified hatred of the player, 24 Killers welcomes you to
                its world with warm arms. Please play it, or share with a friend- it’s a game that anyone can
                (and should!) play.
                </p><h2>Super Metroid</h2><p> <!-- PUT IMAGE HERE AMY -->
                I will say: I think the size of Ridley in Super Metroid should have been what they stuck with. I
                think a guy that's only slightly under double-tall Samus makes for more agile battles!
                The best boss
                <br><br>
                I played through 2 different versions of Super Metroid: the vanilla version, and a popular map
                and physics modification called Project BASE. Super Metroid's map is famous for striking the
                right balance between labyrinthian and self guiding, and I'm working on a series of pieces that
                are secretly about path design in videogames. Project BASE is notable in that it's map edits
                mainly connect previously unconnected paths. These additions are often properly gated, allowing
                for slightly new (sometimes slightly nonlinear) paths through the game. The built-in randomizer
                features less bottlenecks compared to Vanilla Super Metroid Randomized as a result.
                <br><br>
                These were the most productive playthroughs of any video game I've ever played: I developed a
                really neat process for path analysis in videogames (and yes, it is entirely different and much
                better than Mark Brown's logic gate mapping (this is not a ding, Mark Brown is fine I just think
                his boss keys analysis falls short about the complexity of how Super Metroid uses space to guide
                the player, including players who don't "play along")), so look forward to seeing that in a
                string of reviews in either Late 2024 or early 2025! Definitely 2025.
                </p><h2>TOTK</h2><p>
                <br><br>
                I attempted to write all of my thoughts on TOTK, and then it got too long (if you have read my
                other reviews you should know what kind of extreme, we're talking). Here is my better, condensed
                review of TOTK: it is like trying to eat and entire watermelon and succeeding.
                <br><br>
                Watermelon is my favorite fruit. When the season comes, I buy the best one at the market, fridge
                it, cut it in half, and serve it. I am able to eat 1/3rd of a watermelon in one sitting. I did
                so several times while playing Tears of the Kingdom. I always want to eat the whole damn thing.
                <br><br>
                You cannot, eat the whole damn thing. It would physically kill you. Because TOTK is one of those
                big modern games that has an ending best served in the early-middle of the experience, it does
                not have a point where you know to get off the bus. You finish the game with so much of the
                world untouched! How can you not reach for more?
                <br><br>
                I ate the whole melon. And I got sick.
                <br><br>
                I will say though, I do not think I am smart or dedicated enough to talk about this game though.
                I have grown tired of watching folks discuss this game that should have the same attitude about
                their own "observations" about the game. Talk to me about this game at your own peril.
                </p><h2>The Adventures of Cookies and Cream</h2><p> <!-- PUT IMAGE HERE AMY -->
                Honestly them bein cute is definitely why I remembered the name of their game all these years,
                unlike RYGAR for the Ps2
                Oh. I forgot to draw Cream’s Umbrella. Oh well!
                <br><br>
                I am old enough to have rented games from Hollywood Video before switching over to Gamefly.
                Because the trash collector for my brain stopped showing up for me sometime in the 5th grade, I
                remember every game that I couldn't finish (because the weekend rentals were far cheaper) due to
                lack of skill.
                <br><br>
                This was not one of those games.
                <br><br>
                My dad grew up playing videogames, and my mom played many games with him. My brother was soon to
                play videogames, my sister had been the primary user of the N64, and my Bruncle's PlayStation
                was so coveted that he had it on lock in his often oddly situated room in the household. The
                odds were in my favor: someone was going to play this cute video game that definitely required
                two people right??? My dad was working graveyard shift, my Mom was into slower strategy,
                investment, or social games. My brother's gaming days were in his future but not yet his
                present, my sister was too busy attempting to get into college and my bruncle was momentarily
                absent in my family (and mostly liked games that used his PS1 Steering wheel controller).
                <br><br>
                Nobody wanted to play this stupid game with me, and I was too uncoordinated to believe for a
                second that "2 characters, one controller" was the intended experience. I never made it past the
                first world.
                <br><br>
                I have talked about this game as a regretful memory for 20 actual years. For 3 of those years, I
                inexplicably thought that this game was the origin of Sonic Team's Cream the Rabbit. I want to
                say my Dad told me this for some reason. He must have known better. When I played Elden Ring for
                the first time last year, I learned that apparently it was Fromsoft who made The Adventures of
                Cookies and Cream.
                <br><br>
                This year, in 2023, I realized that I now had someone who would willingly play this stupid game
                with me finally.
                <br><br>
                We made it up to the music level, the second world in the game. It was not a good time. The
                timing on some of the obstacles is extremely tight, and there just wasn't enough buy in for-us.
                <br><br>
                2 months later I would go on to write too many words about a game I had waited a decade twice
                over to play, and how my life had compressed that time into dust. It only now occurs to me that
                I waited litterally twenty years to play a game I didn't like.
                <br><br>
                Oh Well!
                </p><h2>Pikmin 2 Co-op</h2><p> <!-- PUT IMAGE HERE AMY -->
                Look at em go
                Someone else drew this. They are very proud of it.
                <br><br>
                We were tasty for some co-op, so we opted to try out a newer mod for pikmin 2 that allowed for
                splitscreen co-op. It was fun, but we did not finish. The real deal was soon to release, and
                Pikmin 2's dungeons were a stressful affair to navigate as a team. We did not return to Pikmin 2
                as we both played through Pikmin 4, a game that I feel (in short) supercedes 2's goals.
                </p><h2>PIKMIN 4</h2><p> <!-- PUT IMAGE HERE AMY -->
                Honestly I just like the framing of the dog in this pic
                You know, this image was drafted vertically originally. It looked better that way! I never got
                around to doing *that* version. Oh well!
                <br><br>
                I wrote an extremely long review. You can read it here. I don't have much more to say, other
                than that Pikmin 4 is the first game to bring Pikmin to a broader audience without compromising
                any of the previous game's ambitions. I'm not even sure I would want more.
                <br><br>
                What I *WILL* discuss is a postmortem on my review:
                <br><br>
                Pikmin is an incredibly important game to me, and I made sure to set my expectations real low
                for Pikmin 4. Putting a dog in the game was not enough to sell me that they had lofty ambitions
                for Pikmin's carefully manicured complexity. I was so satisfyingly wrong that my head swelled
                with ambition- I had just recently failed to complete and exceedingly long and complex review,
                so I knew I needed a strong structure to guarantee success for myself. While I jokingly titled
                the first section of the review (I often use section titles as a way to outline my thoughts) the
                Impact Site, the gimmick of the piece fell into place: Write a review that structurally mirrors
                the 5 stages of the original Pikmin, a game whose structure to me is like if God operated a
                buffet that you could live in.
                <br><br>
                At this point, the review almost wrote itself. Pikmin 4 required discussing the historical and
                my personal context, as so much of itself builds upon the foundation of Pikmin 2 and 3's
                (sometimes misguided) attempts to build a sequel to Pikmin 1-s o I was lucky that Pikmin's
                second stage is more or less a meatier extrapolation of the tutorial in the first stage. It was
                clear that longest and most explicitly structured part of the review (the actual review of
                Pikmin 4's successes) would take place in the third section, mirroring the Forrest Navel, one of
                the best strategy puzzle maps to ever grace video games. The 4th section became a loose
                collection of thoughts to mirror that games 4th stage, and it is by far the most gleefully
                unstructured pieces of writing I've ever put out. It was fun! It turns out writing via collage
                is a fun sort of challenge in itself!
                <br><br>
                I have been told by a few select cool people that this review is "very good and cool" and I
                still get joy thinking about that. It's a really long and insular piece of writing about the
                passage of time and I never would have thought that would have appealed to others- I don't
                actually aim to write for others often. It is a joy to I find myself a wonderful small audience
                of folks to write for. Before I forget, thank you for reading any amount of what I put out. Just
                the fact that people read is enough to keep me making.
                <br><br>
                In other words, I'm really thankful for Pikmin 4- I would say I owe the first productive year
                creatively for myself because of it. Although I wish I was a better illustrater when I was
                writing this review. My later piece this year shows remarkable improvement in that department.

                Someone else drew this. They are not proud of it.
                <br><br>
                I like VideoBall! I wish more people played it so I could enjoy it exclusively as a team with
                someone. I don't know how to solve that sort of thing. The people who play it now are very nice
                and much better than me.
                <br><br>
                What I *WILL* say is that it has an extremely good arcade mode that acts as an amazing on ramp
                to the game if you have a friend, and that my taste in custom music is much better than anyone
                else who plays the game currently (that being said the original soundtrack for it is extremely
                good.)
                </p><h2>Long Live the Queen</h2><p> <!-- PUT IMAGE HERE AMY -->
                I just really like outfits with those stupid shoulder tassles, okay?
                I did not go back and fix her left eye. Oh well!
                <br><br>
                This was a game that was recommended to me by someone cool in a community I hang in (do not find
                me). I occasionally work on a project (that may or may not see the light of day) in the "raise
                'em up" genre of games- the person I work with is vaguely familiar with the Princess Maker
                games, although we were attempting to frame the game differently with a focus on wellbeing. I
                asked the discord community I frequent for recommendations in the genre for research purposes
                when someone recommended me Long Live the Queen. She has saved me a lot of time and exposed me
                to a world I had not yet poked at. What a game!!!
                <br><br>
                I am nowhere near "done" with Long Live the Queen, and will continue to poke at it in my free
                time, but here is the short pitch for those of you curious: you plan the lessons and skills for
                a young queen to learn so she can rule her kingdom, uncover mysteries, and survive (sometimes
                literally) her tenure as ruler. You are quite often forced to make decisions that nearly always
                ripple effect into later decisions. The process becomes so natural that a truly radiant
                narrative about "your" queen happens: my first playthrough ended in death due to failing to
                prevent the assassination of a relative of someone I had put to death. Her trial was somewhat a
                consequence of my early inadvisable foreign policy and a growing harsh glee my ruler had taken
                on- she was trying to slow down the threat of looming espionage occurring within the castle
                walls. I had not even gotten far into the game, but I was experiencing a narrative that truly
                and verifiably was a unique outcome of my numerous decisions.
                <br><br>
                I will continue to poke at this game because I hope that someday I can speak comprehensively to
                the narrative triumphs it makes all the way back in 2012. For now I will say this: It is
                definitely a game putting your time in and seeing how far you get. Incredible lessons to be had
                in narrative design.
                <br><br>
                And yes, you can turn off the music in the options. You do hear those loops a LOT so I say that
                with no judgment: Its hard to make repeated music in this sort of context, I know from personal
                experience.

                I don't like this drawing!
                Judgement.
                <br><br>
                This was originally a Gamefly rental. I had mistakenly thought I had never played it, but I soon
                realized that the short lived Iphone port I played in High School was, in fact, the same
                wonderful game I had picked up once from Gamefly. The reason for my confusion was my primary
                memory: the cutscenes involving the cubic girl and her family as you restored various
                constellations (it was this game that introduced me to the confusion that she was calling the
                crab constellation cancer, for some reason).
                <br><br>
                I don't have much to say about Katamari Damacy because I also played We Love Katamari this year,
                and that game is everything that Damacy might lack for some players (snappier controls, for
                one).
                <br><br>
                What I *will* say is that the best level is the one where they let you go full ham on the crater
                village map with the market in the center, which also is the best track on the OST.

                I'm so glad I got an ink that scans now- no more iphone photos!
                I really liked experimenting with the skin texture- I wanted to have it hang closer to the noisy
                texture from the original Half Life
                <br><br>
                I wrote about my thoughts already here. I make it a habit to repay kindness with my full
                attention, and I truly enjoyed being able to finish the last bit of Half Life I had never
                played. Little did I know that a very special anniversary update of the original Half-Life would
                be released late 2023. In 2024, I will be sure to do a victory lap around Half Life's excellent
                campaign.
                </p><h2>We Love Katamari</h2><p> <!-- PUT IMAGE HERE AMY -->
                Look! The best cousin!
                Wow I sure do wish I drew a better picture!
                <br><br>
                You should get this. I played the original version, but I'm sure the remake is equally fine. You
                wouldn't think a game as pure as Katamari Damacy would have *This* good of sequel, but it does!
                It's actually better! The OST is firing on full cylinders, the challenge levels are far more
                compelling, and I love being able to play as different little guys!
                <br><br>
                I'm serious, both games are good, but We Love Katamari will make it so you never want to play
                another Katamari game again.

                I was going to redraw this, but I ran out of time and realized I just liked the orignal scratch
                drawing. Oh well!
                I drew this when it came out. It’s small because it’s on a sticky note
                <br><br>
                I haven't played Jet Set Radio Future, but something tells me I just did.
                <br><br>
                That being said, that is literally the last I would dare to compare this game to Jet Set Radio-
                it crafts its own identity and standard of quality that surpasses my time spent with Jet Grind
                Radio- and I love that game a lot.
                <br><br>
                BRC aims to provide a LOT less friction than JSR, and this may flavor your preemptive opinion on
                the game, but it DOES have its own joyous style and it's maps ARE a treat to fully explore and
                soak up your time to a really well put together soundtrack.
                <br><br>
                What I can say personally about it: This is a game that understands what its like to ride a bike
                as a way of getting around to exactly nowhere and everywhere. You ziptie a stereo to your
                handlebars and wind down the paths in your set in stone town until the sun sets- I never thought
                I would see that replicated in a game, let alone a goofy one with a decent amount of action, but
                here we are. It was worth my time, and its probably worth yours.
                </p><h2>Cave Story</h2><p> <!-- PUT IMAGE HERE AMY -->
                You know what, message me if you're actually reading my alt text- I'm serious. I wonder if folks
                read these
                When I wrote the following paragraph, I thought it would be fun to draw balrog. It was not! I
                have made them small in an attempt to hide my shame.
                <br><br>
                Cave story is good. I got it for free! Its a game that's good in a time that it was hard to
                independently make games that were good. I got bodied by the final boss yes, but it's clear that
                it's charming vibe would set it up in people's minds forever.
                <br><br>
                I would have maybe skipped over talking about it because I have little to add, but I really
                wanted to draw Balrog.
                </p><h2>Silent Hill</h2><p> <!-- PUT IMAGE HERE AMY -->
                <br><br>
                I don't think I realized these were adventure games. Silent Hill is an extremely good adventure
                game. Effortlessly cinematic, while managing to achieve my favorite kind of horror: the funny
                kind.
                <br><br>
                Let me tell you: I laughed a lot playing this game. Their are so many good setups!!! And I love
                the sort of game that kicks you in the face for playing it right at the end. I really want to
                spoil the "bad" ending so bad because I think it is a perfect example of the kind of bravery
                this game exhudes, but just play it for yourself. It's so good!! Don't worry if you cant beat
                the final boss! Just have a good time!

                I loved this film. You can watch it on The Internet Archive with Subtitles.
                <br><br>
                I will hold off saying too much in depth as I am no familiar with Japan in general, let alone in
                this time period. However:
                <br><br>
                My dad was a grocer. Worked it as a career his whole life. He started in the 80’s, and for him
                he saw it as a respectable career. Society would come to disagree with him as corporate
                supermarkets would roll over the competition. With that context, this film meant a lot to me. In
                particular, it’s really smart about a key contradiction: Hanako fights to save the local
                supermarket from bargain hocking, hack-fraud bigger business supermarkets, but the film is
                keenly aware that supermarkets killed an entire way of life itself. In the film, the fish
                department head and the butcher clash heads with Hanako. The fish man used to own a fish store-
                a victim of the homogenization that supermarkets necessitated. The film acknowledges this, and
                the second half of the movie is (mostly) about this very subject!!!
                <br><br>
                It’s a good movie. It’s also funny and charming, so please watch it.
                </p><h2>Before the Green Moon</h2><p> <!-- PUT IMAGE HERE AMY -->
                This was a tough one to draw. Trying to preserve the low poly feel WITHOUT polies is really
                tough.
                As a note, this was my avatar in the game- not any particular character.
                <br><br>
                Someday, soon, I will write a lot more about this game. It is my game of the year. You should
                buy it. Right now. Even if it isn't on sale.
                <br><br>
                This game was brought to my attention when I posed a favorite question of mine: to what extant
                can a videogame be biographical? I did not initially know how this game would answer my
                question, but it did. Before the Green Moon is a triumph of narrative expression in a video
                game- a champion unlike all others. You arrive at dying, thriving town at the foot of your one
                ticket out of a world we abandoned. The game understands the exact relationship we have with
                work- the way folks often come to incidentally live the rest of their lives. It *IS* a
                fantastical game, and you CAN fantastically bring folks together- who is to say that isn't life
                itself? The small miracle that any of us find each other?
                <br><br>
                I'm dodging around certain narrative elements. Before the Green Moon isn't a game with narrative
                twists and turns, and it returns exactly what you're willing to put into it. What I received was
                one of the most cathartic and exploratory meditations on what "home" really means. Stop reading.
                Play it. Form your opinions. Witness the future of narrative expression in videogames. It's
                execution of its moods, themes, and scenes is unmatched by anything I have ever played. I know
                I'm sort of rambling, but it's going to be another year before I have my thoughts out and
                organized about what is now one of my favorite games of all time.
                </p><h2>F-ZERO 99</h2><p> <!-- PUT IMAGE HERE AMY -->
                <br><br>
                I don't have much to say, other than that Big Blue is maybe a perfect piece of Videogame OST. I
                can loop it endlessly with nearly no abraision- and I sure do with FZero 99 had sound mixing
                that pushed the soundtrack to the front of the mix.
                </p><h2>Outer Wilds</h2><p> <!-- PUT IMAGE HERE AMY -->
                <br><br>
                I managed to go spoiler-free until I had a chance to finally play, and I am so glad I did- if
                you have somehow done the same, please play Outer Wilds, right now.
                <br><br>
                Outer Wilds is perhaps the perfect game for the curious- it understands a good walk in a way
                that few games do, and the overarching setup of the game creates a structure that necessarily
                organizes the players thinking for them- which for a game with this many mysteries is a design
                achievement. I'll put it this way: In a game where going to other planets is as easy as playing
                a videogame, it is an amazing achievement that they managed to also instill a facsimile of the
                accomplishment involved in successfully landing on the moon. If you've played, you know exactly
                what I'm refferring to.
                <br><br>
                To speak to my own thoughts: my favorite moment in the game is discovering a lab, attempting to
                recreate the experiment without a complete set of notes, and getting the same documented result
                as the long gone researchers. That's it! That's your reward! It isn't a mechanical revelation
                either- it only serves as a setup to explain the exact workings of the sci-fi at play (and it is
                *extremely* funny what is happening).
                <br><br>
                And if you still aren't sold, I will spoil the elevator pitch of the game: On the last day of
                the Universe, you set out to discover the last unsolved mystery the universe holds.
                <br><br>
                Please play this game. There's a reason it made all this noise.
                </p><h2>VOID STRANGER</h2><p> <!-- PUT IMAGE HERE AMY -->
                This image was made to be printed in an indie paper. It did not end up happening, because it
                turns out they wanted irreverant gags to sell ads instead of stuff talking about the arts. Oh
                well! (okay seriously i'm not actually bitter on that one. I get it)
                I realized I didn’t have to color this one!
                <br><br>
                I'm frustrated with how others discuss this game. The sentiment that it's "secretly a good game"
                digs into me deep- the game is just plainly genius! It's really good!
                <br><br>
                The soundtrack is good! The broader structure is good! The miles of extra content is good! The
                game has satisfactory off ramps for players with differing amounts of investment! I love the way
                the narrative unfolds! I feel like they push the envelope for games own developing sense of
                "gameatography," if you will!
                <br><br>
                What I see instead is folks screaming "come play the new Tower of Druaga while its hot!" And
                sure, it's totally that as well, but I would *NOT* say that is the selling point for the game.
                In fact, I've found that it encourages players to immediately grow suspsiscious of the
                designers, plotting to outsmart the developers rather than, you know, play the game! Void
                Stranger does not hold up if you don't simply play it. It doesn't! The thing that makes it's
                arcane box of secrets good is that there is plenty of cake for players like me to eat and leave
                the party feeling satisfied!
                <br><br>
                And it's true: if you do not like Sokoban style puzzles (it's not a lot of proper Sokoban block
                puzzles technically but it has its own specific kind of strict movement/consequences design
                loop) this game doesn't have much to offer you!
                <br><br>
                This is all to say: I love this game. If it wasn't for the fact that 24 Killers, Pikmin 4, and
                Before the Green Moon came out this year it would make it out on to my top 3. I think a LOT of
                people should play this game, and they should definitely return it if they don't like everything
                up to the end of chapter 2. I simply wish that others could step out of their own feverish love
                (which is good!) when reccomending and describing the game to others- but at the end of the day
                it IS a game that is worth your time, and a game I will pull out to my non-game-playing friends
                as an example of the ever continuing development of the artform.
                </p><h2>Mario WONDER</h2><p> <!-- PUT IMAGE HERE AMY -->
                These are the best new enemies... they're so violently reactive
                Can you tell I forgot to scan it?
                <br><br>
                When Mario Maker (and its sequel) released, the common dunk was "wow, Nintendo is now
                crowdsourcing their next Mario game!" I do not dare to go that far, but it is clear to me that
                Nintendo was taking notes. I'll do some gamer taxes and say: I liked Mario Wonder! A lot! I Like
                exactly 80%, and weirdly nearly all 80% happens linearly- I think Nintendo learned too many
                lessons from Mario Maker when it comes to "how to make a challenging level"- they used to be
                really good at that!
                <br><br>
                I will rattle off some bullet points, in no particular order about Mario Wonder. I am doing this
                because I have enough thoughts to fill a detailed analysis of the entire game, but I *REALLY*
                don't want to do that, not here, not now, not ever.
                <br><br>
                1. There is a lot of Mario Worlds DNA in it. As you already know (or will soon learn) I've loved
                Mario World longer than I could read. So what do I mean when I say when I say there is a lot of
                Mario World in Mario Wonder? To be quicker:
                <br><br>
                a. Levels the lean on chaotic interaction with bursts of speed and well thought out vignettes.
                <br><br>
                b. A willingness to experiment with level order and structure in the broader context of a map.
                In the desert world, you do nearly all levels in whatever order you discover them as you wander
                a literal desert, trying to break in to a palace that has only a few entrances into. That was a
                cool sentence to type!!! IF there was some weirder way to skip around to different worlds in
                different order (since you have to clear them all to beat the game anyways) it would have been a
                slam dunk.
                <br><br>
                c. A delicate approach to Mario's powerup states. They actually do this better than Mario World
                (yes people struggle to love the flower, but having yoshi balances the cape by disallowing the
                free flying, which is a really clever way to balance having 2 different powerup systems in the
                game). Mario Wonder's powerups feel properly transformative in how you interact with the world
                without leaving the fire flower in the dust. None of them give you chores either! I'm looking
                right at you, ice flower!!!!!
                <br><br>
                2. The shorter "break" levels are an amazing implementation. Mario is best when you're just
                sorta doing things, and boy do they give you space to do exactly that.
                <br><br>
                3. They have given up on thinking that bossess are fun in Mario- I generally agree! I like how
                sparing they are here with them (the bowser junior water boss is my favorite!).
                <br><br>
                4. A lot of enemies were crafted to have specific behaviors, often implementing long gone
                behaviors of Mario's past. The slugs that get kicked out of their shell replicating Mario
                World's koopa behavior comes to mind. I like this! There are a lot of unique little enemies that
                never get enough time to shine, and I can already feel people getting ready for a Mario Maker 3
                featuring only Mario Wonder elements. If they made that: It's a shame it would have the worst
                soundtrack of any Mario game! Oops!
                <br><br>
                5. Of course I love all the dumb characters. They're great and they're so generous- I just love
                em.
                <br><br>
                This got me thinking of Mario. A dangerous amount of Mario, in fact. Stay tuned.

                I did not come up with the Ashi can gag. The reference Tia gave me had it in there and it was
                too tempting to not have it on the cover since I had negative space there
                Most of the folks on here are somewhat author avatars. I use Robot Jones, The MGS Duck (i know
                its not from MGS, i think) Is Jai, The monkey is BIG LOU, Tia is chillin with the can in the
                back, Bunp is the black cat, who is hunting the Floigan Brothers’ mouse Asmo, a character I
                created for my comic adaptation of the Floigan Bros.
                <br><br>
                On a complete whim, I ended up hosting a modest zine jam from the discord community I hang
                around in mostly. I guess if you made it this far, you DO get to find me.

                I've always had a fascination for malls- in some places, they outnumber parks and walkable town
                centers. They're also dying by the droves, and I thought the idea of eulogizing this passing
                destructive cultural movement would be an interesting jumping off point to make stuff. Turns out
                others agreed! Link below, please read if you have the time- it is a better put together,
                cohesive final package than a lot of zines out there. That's not me dissing zines, they're great
                and I love them: what's inside is a step above and I'm super happy all of these talented people
                came together to share their work with me.

                Surprisingly, there are folks still working on stories for issue 1.5 of My Mall Memorial (more

                Don't be afraid to reach out if you also wanted to participate- the more the merrier! I am

                </p><h2>Super Mario World</h2><p> <!-- PUT IMAGE HERE AMY -->
                I used this image only for the end of the article- I was really nervous to give away Ludwig's
                weird teeth in the credits
                I actually duplicated Morton’s Mouth onto ludwig using old school methods: i cut out a photo
                copy of mortons maw and taped it over the finished drawing to scan it fresh.
                <br><br>
                I wrote an article about Mario World. You might have read it. I spent a rough total of 220
                working hours making this story happen (it's my impetus for logging my hours) and I will admit:
                I totally started working on it while I was doing the zine jam, and it's totally why my comic
                submission was only 2 pages long. While I do dramatically touch on what drove me to dedicate so
                many hours in such a short time to this story, the truth is simple: It was a good story. It was
                truthful and personal, and it was one of those "go the distance" stories I was capable of doing.
                I loved it, and I knew I wouldn't get a story this good for a good while.
                <br><br>
                A brief postmortem:
                <br><br>
                The article itslef speaks enough to the process of researching and learning the assembly skills
                required, so I will let that be.
                <br><br>
                I will say: I did not mean to be so mean to the Mario World Rom-Hacking Community (lol), but I
                do think they have a couple of omnipresent bastions of information who are so burnt out from
                smaller annoyances that they have developed an itchy trigger finger for blasting
                question-havers. This sucks! I've continued to watch the community from afar and totally
                innocent people get blasted for just not knowing as much as the people who wrote the guides- one
                of which written by someone who gleefully tells you they're not going to walk you through
                examples because "that's for you to do." If you don't immediately get what I mean, I would have
                to explain the complexities of education, skill floors, barrier to entries, and inclusion. I
                could!!! But It exhausts me and is worth a write up that examines the issue seriously and isn't
                written by me. Just know this: Lots of people learn, people struggle with different things, and
                unless you plan, accept, and cushion correction to misunderstandings, you are discriminating
                against who is "worth" learning from you whether you know it or not.
                <br><br>
                I litterally worked on the final hours of this article feverishly. I worked on it until the
                exact moment the article felt like a bad problem to get off my back- in which I posted it, went
                to bed, and then woke up delerious from sudden bout of COVID. Covid is one of the few things
                that cuases me not to be lucid, so the extremely warm reception I received upon posting from my
                loyalest of readers meant a lot to me in a literal, metaphysical sense. It feels unreal. It's
                not "stupid success" sure, but I really don't want that. 100 people clicked on it! That's
                nuts!!! I know of like 10 people who finished it and liked it!!! That's crazy! I only ever
                wanted like 2!
                <br><br>
                I'm still mostly proud of it. Nothing particularly got cut, as much as I wanted to explain
                memory addresses and the fun way the SNES is split up (the first values in the ROM are
                essentially pointers to matching Ram numbers like $700000 addresses away so they can just call
                like 2 digit numbers for ram addresses- it's pretty neat!!) but ultimately explaining binary and
                hexadecimal for a hypothetical general reader was already a large task.
                <br><br>
                I'm going to post the screenshot of my fixed credits screen in game:
                It was an extremely strange feeling seeing this image. It was over- there were no more issues.
                This sort of thing doesn't happen, nor does it happen quickly for me ever. I still feel weird
                looking at this, like it was always meant to be.
                <br><br>
                This is the most unreal part of it for me. Rarely do I get to have a solid answer to questions
                from my childhood. I know it seems like such a minor change, but it's just nutty to me- this
                game, this world was present at the pouring of my brains foundation, and here I am at my current
                age with enough knowledge to reach in and change it.

                When I wrote the 2022 version of this piece last year (and decided last minute to not publish) I
                wrote the words "I don't feel like I'm smart enough to talk about Mario World." I don't feel
                like that's the case anymore! Expect to hear something from me about Mario World sometime...
                late 2024/early 2025? The worth will be wait it, I promise.
                <br><br>
                As some of you may know, I play Mario World every year of my life. In my adulthood I vary my
                playthroughs to learn something new. When I finished the article, I thought "surely, this
                counts. I've learned a lot about Mario World. There's no way I could stomach more Mario."
                </p><h2>JUMP 1/2 (and other Mario Rom Hacks)</h2><p> <!-- PUT IMAGE HERE AMY -->
                <br><br>
                Okay, I got the Mario Hacking Bug. You may (AND THAT'S A BIG MAY) see some levels from me in the
                future, because let me tell you: I do not think a lot of people understand what makes Mario
                World special. In fact, I think a lot of people wish Mario World played a lot more like Mario 3,
                and IN FACT, I think a lot of people ALSO don't understand what makes Mario 3 briskly fun!
                <br><br>
                I played a lot of small hacks, which I will not name, that all suffered from a short list of
                common level design problems:
                <br><br>
                1. Too cramped.
                <br><br>
                2. Setpieces and vignettes have no breathing room.
                <br><br>
                3. Levels overstay their welcome.
                <br><br>
                4. Difficulty is true, rather than a fun illusion.(I did not play Kaizo or hard hacks)
                <br><br>
                5. Level geometry lacks proper runways- Mario World's favorite trick is to give you just enough
                runway to gain speed, only to hit you with an obstacle that demands you slow down. This presents
                a choice: be responsible, or make the irresponsible choice of having fun tyring to keep your
                speed. Slow mode Mario World is not fun prolonged.
                <br><br>
                6. Everyone is afraid to put the cape and Yoshi in levels. You cowards! They're fun! Balance
                your level around flyers! Mario World does this for levels! You're really going to make more
                Mario World and *not* put in everyone's favorite parts of Mario World???? Do you really think
                videogames are about dying???? You can make it a lot harder if you give me a
                dinosaur!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
                <br><br>
                I did, however, play a very interesting hack: Jump 1/2 , a collaborative hack featuring a mix of
                levels both odd, traditional, themed, gimmicky, plain, and difficult. It's mostly good, and I
                played it mostly to completion! Some bullet point notes:
                <br><br>
                -Some levels were extremely good, but about a quarter of the levels ran into the problems listed
                above
                <br><br>
                -Some levels do not understand difficulty.
                <br><br>
                -half of the levels should have been split into two levels. I get that this is a large
                collaboration and so you can't do that, but too many levels overstay their welcome. In a smaller
                hack with only a quarter of the ideas, you could have afforded to break up level concepts into
                more discrete levels. In fact, this was some of my most common Mario Maker advice back when
                folks used to hit me up for tips: youre level is too long, if you really want to keep that last
                part, put it in a sequel and see how you feel. That goal should mean "you did it, good job!" and
                nearly never "It's over..."
                <br><br>
                Use a rewind function and you could have a good time with a lot of the ideas however- some of
                the folks in this hack understand what makes Mario World special, and it was worth me sifting
                through the rest to see that. Surely, this counts as my annual Mario World, right?
                </p><h2>Super Mario World from Memory</h2><p> <!-- PUT IMAGE HERE AMY -->
                Seriously, look at Rip Van Fish. Do you know how much that made me laugh?
                I asked a friend to draw the Mario World enemies from memory. Yes, that really was their best
                guess for Rip Van Fish. They were serious.
                <br><br>
                I thought this would be something that felt closer to Mario World enough to learn something.
                Unfortunately, all I learned was that people don't know Mario World! Apparently, all the little
                gag details about where enemies are placed based on the timing of your jumps just isn't what's
                remembered!
                <br><br>
                I did not finish. I'll spoil you: I did end up just playing Mario World soon enough.
                </p><h2>Godzilla Minus One</h2><p> <!-- PUT IMAGE HERE AMY -->
                <br><br>
                Really I just wanted to share this nice drawing of Godzilla I made. This is maybe my favroite
                Godzilla Movie of all time. You should see it! It's really good. It's like a proper good movie!
                Okay, back to looking at this nice drawing of a big Godzilla again.
                </p><h2>Mario World (no secret exits)</h2><p> <!-- PUT IMAGE HERE AMY -->
                I’ve always preferred his old design.
                <br><br>
                I ended up having a bad day, and for some cozy comfort I decided to play Vanilla Mario World
                (with my credits fix patch) with a typical annual alteration: no secret exits! I don't do this
                sort of thing out of a boredom- I just like to learn new things about one of my favorite games!
                Previously, I had done No Switches, No Yoshi, and No Cape. All 3 of those years were extremely
                fruitful explorations, and this year was sort of the same: It turns out when you willfully
                refuse to engage with the game structure's core conceit, you miss out on some of the best
                content in Mario World. Choco Island is outright an irredeemable mess if you don't take the
                alternate route through, and Vanilla dome BEGS you to find the secret way out, even if you don't
                find yourself stuck behind the difficulty walls that are Vanilla Dome 4 and Lemmy's castle.
                <br><br>
                What WAS fun was that I streamed this playthrough to the discord server I hang out in! It was a
                lot of fun- I think I'm going to take up streaming more in what I consider a cozy space. Having
                2-5 folks chatting up a storm while I get to talk about my favorite game was definitely
                something for the books.
                </p><h2>Klonoa: Door to Phantomile</h2><p> <!-- PUT IMAGE HERE AMY -->
                It's okay, he wasn't *your* Grandpa
                Little does he know…
                <br><br>
                I am a Klonoa 2 die hard. I rented it several times as a kid and played it to its bones, but I
                had yet to play the original title for the Playstation. I *did* make it all the way to the
                penultimate final boss in the wii remake, but I found that it failed to charm me in a variety of
                ways.
                <br><br>
                Turns out, the Playstation version is a crowning achievement!
                <br><br>
                There's a lot of movement in the stages themselves, and the game's trademark excellence in
                quietly tutorialising the player in increasingly harder tasks is on full display. The music is
                excellent, and every time I have picked up a Klonoa game I arrive closer to a day where "munyah"
                becomes a natural and accepted interjection for misery.

                Speaking of Misery: I am struck by how bizarrely cruel the game's narrative is. I always knew
                some great sadness was suffered as the backdrop of Klonoa 2's uniquely moody narrative, but the
                original title put's Klonoa through literally fictional pain that almost feels senselessly
                cruel. There's a part of me that wonders if they always knew they wanted a deep pain and
                betrayal in the main characters heart for a sequel to expand upon- never did I think that I
                could loathe someone as handcraftedly adorable as Huepow. Huepow!
                <br><br>
                I think the game looks fine on playstation, and that's the version you should play. For Klonoa
                2, I am truly split down the middle, so it's dealers choice- but emulation is still the way to
                go for enjoying the original. And yes, Wahoo's tacos *is* real- when I went to college, it was
                an odd experience to see Wahoo's signage enter my cornea as proof that it wasn't a bizarre
                stunt-ad fiction.

                <br><br>
                2023 was a year that I truly came into my own. I'm secure in my job finally, I have enough time
                to work on creative projects like a second job now, I have put out things I am proud of, I can
                stand to look at my own ink work, and I have finally begun to open up in communities both online
                and IRL. I share thoughts with ease, sure, but emotions I often fail to put in to words. I am
                very happy, and I am not used to being happy. It is a nice feeling.
                <br><br>
                Before I tell you some of the things I want to do in 2024, I want to say thank you for reading.
                This piece espescially is a bit more for me than it is for you, but I like that people do
                actually read what I put out. It brings me immense joy.

                And with that, the year is put to past. Thank you for reading. Just having anyone enjoy my work
                means a heck of a lot to me, I'm humbled constantly. I hope I can be more open with others- in
                the real world, I do not struggle with this but online in chat spaces I am a stone cold wall. I
                hope to change this a bit, and I thank you all for your patience with me, even if I am distant
                at times.

                I used to think everything matters, and that nobody could quite see that. As I got older, it was
                proved to me: everyone forgot what I could never. "Why is this so important to you?" became a
                dreadful question. I love everyone. I wish nothing more than everyone to be okay, despite
                knowing there is unwritable sadness at the core of their very being. I have felt this way since
                I was in high school, but it wouldn't be until 2022 that I read an entirely different person
                from me write this exact sentiment, and following their career lead me to a community I couldn't
                be more thankful for. I feel just a bit more connected to really cool folks in a space that I
                can just exist in- and while I do not know the person who wrote those words stolen from the
                hearth of my soul, knowing I am not alone in the exactitude of a particular feeling has allowed
                for a necessary healing to take place. This was the first year of my life where I did not
                endlessly search the archives of my memories for the answers of "what the hell is wrong with
                me?" I knew. I finally knew, and I was at peace with it. I still go digging through the shelves
                of my past selves and will not be able to stop, and the culprit of my missing piece is not
                something I feel the need to share (at least not in the exact community I hang out in- lol), but
                know this: I can type the following mistranslation of a Scottish poem with absolute certainty:
                <br><br>
                <i>Would old acquaintance be forgot,
                <br><br>
                and never brought to mind?
                <br><br>
                Should once beginings be forgot,
                <br><br>
                And the days of a long gone time?
                <br><br>
                For us and old times sake, my dear
                <br><br>
                for the olden days gone by,
                <br><br>
                we'll tak' a cup o' kindness yet,
                <br><br>
                for the days of auld lang syne.</i>
                <br><br>
                Thank you for reading.
