                <p>     I’ve been playing a game lately. I’m going to write my thoughts on it when it’s done; normally when I
                        play a game I tend to devour every emotion and place packaged in, but Moon demands different.
                        The game is about playing video games, and the kinds of people that games try to make us. Games
                        were often compared to skinner boxes rather than art exhibits. I’m sure there is a whole,
                        beautiful art to installation design in museums, but the cold hard facts state that there is
                        nothing stopping anyone from skimming past any piece they may choose. I like good landscapes and
                        despise bad ones of mechanical skill- no modern layout design can possibly make me stop and
                        consider a tasteless view of a venetian city. Despite the fact that games are one of the other
                        few artforms that are self paced, developers do all they can to ensure a game reveals itself to
                        the player in a way that would make a Hollywood scriptwriter cream their pants.
                        <br><br>
                        <i>moon</i> instead opts to hide itself- it presents a plot that is not unfurled or started by the
                        protagonist and will frustrate the player if they are “looking for the next cutscene.” Once you
                        do enough nice things for people, you can afford to follow people around throughout the week and
                        see what they’re up to while the “hero” gallivants around slaying Claymation fantasy animals.
                        You do nice things for others without saying much, and if you pay attention you might find more
                        nice things to do for others.
                        <br><br>
                        I quit my job recently. I quit my career actually. I’ve never considered myself very often- when
                        you only tolerate yourself its hard to ignore the fact that by basic math everyone else is more
                        important than you (and to you). Teaching was a sort of masochistic self harm- help be slightly
                        less shitty to a bunch of hardworking 14 year olds and try and take pride that you actually do
                        your damn job and understand the severity of it. Maybe someday you’ll get tired, maybe someday
                        you’ll give up, and maybe someday someone will shoot you in the head and that’ll give you an
                        excuse to not teach anymore. Don’t get me wrong- teachers are TOTALLY cops and reinforce a LOT
                        of our problems, but I don’t really think they (or me for that matter) deserve to get shot in
                        the head. Kicked for some of them, sure.
                        <br><br>
                        And I was(kicked), quite a bit in fact. Not everyone knows this, but most hate is disguised and
                        perpetrated in the name of love. Teachers and Admin do this all the time- everyone loves their
                        kids so godamn much and also find a way to base their empathy around how much a kid is willing
                        to “responsibly” fill out glorified paperwork. To prevent the career ending head wound from
                        being self-inflicted, most love to self flagellate their own ability and how much of the world
                        they’re saving by forcing their batch of 14 year olds thru structured kindergarten. I had the
                        misfortune of having a boss who pretended to teach a class, and who would force staff to visit
                        his class and write emails as part of his school’s “excellent and frequent professional
                        development.” At the time, I was being pushed out of the school for supporting the union, and
                        being the obvious square peg in a round hole was not helping.
                        <br><br>
                        I quit. I found a new career I was somehow LESS unqualified for and never looked back. Teaching
                        almost drained me, and almost killed me.
                        <br><br>
                        I’m no longer tired. I want to love again but teaching nearly took my ability to love others
                        without barfing at word like “selfless”, “nurturing”, “loving”, and “hero”. I already had issues
                        believing anyone could love <i>me</i>, now I’m not even sure how anyone loves <i>anyone</i>. Everything is a
                        system, and everyone is figuring it out, and everyone is trying to make it “better,” and
                        everyone is the hero in their own movie, and everyone is trying to coexist with all the other
                        leading stars.
                        <br><br>
                        Typing this I know the answer and the problem it’s going to always pose: I want to love, and I’m
                        not sure I <i>can</i> be loved (or want to be even). To love someone is to know them, and I want to
                        love <i>everyone</i>. I can’t get that little game out of my head for that reason- you don’t win favors
                        or love by doing nice things, those things <i>are</i> love. Normally, when I play games that resonate
                        and mean something to me I can’t help but absorb and devour every emotion, every scene from it
                        immediately.
                        <br><br>
                        I’m playing <i>moon</i> every once and a while so I can love it for as long as I can.</p>
