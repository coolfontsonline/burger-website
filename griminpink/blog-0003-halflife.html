                        Maybe you can tell, but I don't like <i>Half Life 2</i>'s Vortiguant re-design- I wanted to explore the
                        alien physiolgy the noisy textures once implied
                        <br><br>
                        When I was 14 years old, I picked up my copy of The Orange Box which my dad had given me for
                        Christmas several years prior. My dad had a track record of gifting me important, quality
                        videogames years before I could appreciate them since literally my 5th birthday. The Orange box
                        had this effect threefold- I played Portal because I could understand it, I played TF2 because
                        of its cartoon sensibilities (despite its gibs confusing little ol' sheltered me), and I played
                        <i>Half Life 2</i> because it was there. <i>Half Life 2</i> is a game that demands you shoot these guys to get
                        more plot or progress to an "exciting" physics puzzle- So it is strange to consider that it was
                        my inaugural first person shooter, mainly because it couldn't be.
                        <br><br>
                        I played <i>Half Life</i> because I was and forever am a cheap bastard who thinks the devil is going to
                        get me if I spend literally more than 12 dollars on myself. I cannot access my original steam
                        account- me and my brother were forced to share until that became untenable, in which my brother
                        took the kids in the divorce. I don't need to access my original steam account to know <i>Half Life</i>
                        was the first game I ever purchased online, and that it was $8.
                        <br><br>
                        <i>Half Life</i> features a narrative that I've never quite seen replicated- a perfect marriage of
                        functional spaces and intense, hand designed shooter encounters. Not a single enemy feels
                        superfluous, and they all have a unique niche in disposing of inattentive players. You barrel
                        down fever dream hallways until the experience unravels, and then it ends. Why would you want to
                        make a sequel to something like this? Let alone one where you spend your time getting into
                        various cars and fighting what feels like one dude, sometimes with a shotgun if you bought the
                        DLC?
                        <br><br>
                        There *is* more <i>Half Life</i> however: Gearbox (yes, the folks who created <i>Battleborn</i>) made 3ish
                        official(ish) expansions to the original game. To avoid the mitts of Satan from judging my
                        purchasing habits, I would only buy ONE of these expansions two years later. My choice was easy-
                        one was a dead 2 player campaign for the PlayStation, another was a very straightforward level
                        pack from the canceled Dreamcast port, and the last one was <i>Opposing Force</i>. <i>Opposing Force</i> took
                        me 3 failed attempts to finish. It is a game that felt <i>Half Life</i> could benefit from more stuff-
                        I came out understanding why <i>Half Life 2</i> opted for *less* stuff instead.
                        <br><br>
                        I opted not to spend literally more than 12 dollars lest the Devil caress my beautiful, baked to
                        perfection skin, so I wish-listed <i>Half Life</i>: <i>Blue Shift</i> and moved on. I get really weird about
                        finishing things that are important to me; I am currently procrastinating watching the Cowboy
                        Bebop movie as it will be the last time I see any amount of Cowboy Bebop for the first time.
                        <br><br>
                        When I was Today Years old Bunp (a friend of mine who makes really cool zines that are the kind
                        of thing I wish I made and you should read HERE) gifted me a copy of <i>Half Life</i>: <i>Blue Shift</i> a
                        decade after I had wish-listed it. She had descended into hell to grab the keys to the kingdom
                        of heaven and to liberate me from suffering eternal.
                        <br><br>
                        I finally finished <i>Half Life</i>.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>===========================<br>
                        So What did I think of it?<br>
                        ===========================</b>
                        <br><br>
                        <i>Half Life</i>: <i>Blue Shift</i> follows a cop parallel to the events of the original Half-Life- you see
                        hell break loose, you poke around, rescue a scientist who knows something about teleporters, and
                        then go do some chores in an alien world. If you have played the original <i>Half Life</i>, that should
                        sound familiar. <i>Blue Shift</i> does not offer any new mechanics or weapons (unlike its cousin, the
                        military focused <i>Opposing Force</i>) and plays (mostly) as a "best hits" of the original game. The
                        run time is short- I'm literally a household object and I finished it in 3.5 hours- so ideas
                        tend to be pointed and hit hard. I mostly enjoyed it! Smooth paragraph transitions are for
                        luddites- lets discuss:
                        <br><br>
                        <b><i>Where's it coming from?</i></b>
                        <br><br>
                        Gearbox, as the principles of taxonomy dictate, is not Valve but rather a whole other developer.
                        Valve had all of these lofty design visions for their NPC's which had to be cut because you
                        don't get money until *after* the game is sold (it was also 1997). The (friendly) Non Playable
                        Characters fall into two types:
                        <br><br>
                        1. One of Three Scientists dudes who are limited use medkits, open doors, or occasionally offer
                        charmingly voiced exposition
                        <br><br>
                        2. One of One Cops who shoots people or is (as my friend in High School who's cousin I briefly
                        dated described as) "free punchable ammo"
                        <br><br>
                        <b><i>Where's it going?</i></b>
                        <br><br>
                        Gearbox wanted to add more stuff to <i>Half Life</i> (more guns both familiar and alien), and NPCS's
                        were on of their to-do list. In <i>Opposing Force</i>, you often find yourself with a platoon of
                        differing soldiers: one guy is a medic, one guy mainly shoots, and one guy opens doors (with his
                        blow torch). Hey, wait a second! (okay there is also a portly donut loving cop, so atleast the
                        boys in blue are a bit more diverse (I'm going to hurl typing that sentence))
                        <br><br>
                        <i>Blue Shift</i> adds one Dr. Professor Rosenberg, an NPC whom the story centers on. He must be
                        rescued and escorted through several maps, all so he can open an unmarked wall you ran past
                        previously which serves as the entrance to his secret lab. I bring up the good Dr. Professor
                        Rosenberg because there were several times his script which opened this all important door
                        broke- it's the price you pay when you reach for the future.
                        <br><br>
                        So much of <i>Blue Shift</i> feels like an exploration of what was to come in first person shooters-
                        NPCs complex enough to act in escort missions, maps returning to explicit mission objectives
                        beyond "push forward," and the game ends with an honest-to-god horde defense fight as its
                        finale. I would not dare to describe this game modern, but you can see they were attempting to
                        sketch the future.
                        <br><br>
                        <b><i>Where has it gone?</i></b>
                        <br><br>
                        It’s vision of the future is impressive given how much of <i>Blue Shift</i> is built on the ethos of
                        the original <i>Half Life</i>. Everything leading up to finding the good Mr. Doctor Professor Rosenberg
                        is quite good- <i>Half Life</i> had a knack for finding inspirations for firefights in functional
                        spaces, but Gearbox really tried to push design towards functional mundanity (this is a
                        compliment, I swear). The best encounter in the game is technically an optional one: you enter a
                        stair tower in which 3 marines are stationed at the top of the stairs. Running up the treads
                        will send them marching down with the upper hand and engaging them requires using the stair pans
                        themselves for cover as they race down. It is a joy to think about.
                        <br><br>
                        It is entirely optional as well- you don't know this, but the door at the top is locked. You'll
                        eventually loop back around from the other side (with the honorable Mr. Doctor Professor
                        Rosenberg in tow) putting you above those pesky marines. Everything after this loop-around is
                        functionally fine, modern, and toothless. It's clear Gearbox (like many at the time) thought
                        "<i>Half Life</i>'s ending on Xen totally sucks," which I think is only fair regarding the giant mama
                        headcrab and that one very flat level with the jump pads. Gearbox’s take on Xen was "push
                        forward until you find a switch to flip, flipping it spawns some guys to fight" which is fine
                        and toothless. Bold of Gearbox to predict Black Mesa’s approach to Xen!
                        <br><br>
                        The game ends soon after. You find yourself free of your alien chores being last loser out of
                        the portal, which is good because marines with guns storm the cramped lab you've been using as a
                        waiting room. There is little bravado leading up to the moment and there is just as little
                        after- the game literally has the esteemed honorable Mr. Doctor Professor Rosenberg pat you on
                        the back, go "all's well that ends well!" and roll credits.
                        <br><br>
                        It was over. The voice of Big the Cat was telling me I won. I had finished all of <i>Half Life</i>.
                        <br><br>
