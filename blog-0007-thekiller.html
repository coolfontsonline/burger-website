                        KILLER</p>

                <figcaption>October 20th, 2024</figcaption>

        <div class="outline">
                <p>Hello everyone. It’s been a while, hasn’t it? </p>

                <p> I’ve been busy in the kitchen, although I have not been posting the fruits of my labor. It’s time to
                        correct that. </p>

                <p> I recently released (both online and in the REAL WORLD) <b><a href="zines.html">REVIEW OF THE KILLER</a></b>, 
                        a zine review of <a href="https://thecatamites.itch.io/anthology-of-the-killer">ANTHOLOGY OF THE KILLER</a>,
                        my personal game of 2024 and a game <a href="https://thecatamites.itch.io/anthology-of-the-killer">you should definitely play</a>.</p>

                <p> <a href="zines.html">My review is available here.</a> It plays in-browser and is free to read,
                        print, and distribute (at cost, even). I do this because I truly want to see more game related
                        zines out there in the world. Just get weird with it. To help accomplish that goal, as of today
                        you will find updated print versions that are separately optimized for B&W and color, including
                        professional print options such with bleed and the such. I will explain these in good time. </p>

                <p> <a href="https://thecatamites.itch.io/anthology-of-the-killer">Anthology of the Killer is available
                                here.</a>
                        It’s also on steam too, but I don’t think you need my help with that one.
                        Please share with friends as well- its a game thats truly accessible for everyone to get into
                        and play, and its a deeply moving experience when played. This isn’t time to get into the
                        transformative nature of lets-plays vs. played experiences but trust me: this game rules playing
                        it. Play it! Play it. </p>

                <img onclick="window.open(this.src, '_blank');"

                <p> That is quite enough shilling out of me. It’s weird- 5% of you reading this will know me for
                        everything else *but* this, and the rest of you *only* know me for this. This is going to
                        continue to happen as I make things since I tend to make things about a lot of things, many
                        things even. Is it strange for a fisherman to ponder about the fish in their net? For a fisher
                        to ponder how the fish don’t hang out regular at the dive bar down the street? </p>

                <p> The point of this post is less “impress you with prose” and more-so “engross you with behind the
                        scenes, my artistic process, and decisions that went into making the final review.” The only
                        thing I like more than art is talking about the making of that art. In other words: this one is
                        going to be more off the cuff! I will try to edit for clarity, but don’t expect great prose in
                        this one! </p>

                <p> Yes that’s how you keep your audience. Lower their expectations… </p>

                <img onclick="window.open(this.src, '_blank');" src="assets/blog/0007-thekiller/Sticky.jpg" />

                <p> Let me dial back the clock: friend of the show (me. i’m the show) <a
                                href="https://harmfulpark.neocities.org/">Harmful Park</a> (<a
                                href="https://harmfulpark.neocities.org/">find them here</a>,OR support <a
                                href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2412000/OneThousand_Cuts/">their friends game
                                One Thousand Cuts</a>) told me I should check it out. Over the course of two days I
                        experience the most profound emotional release I had from a game this year: The review was
                        always going to happen. I posted the original sticky note promo as a way of tricking myself into
                        making it real. I decided that if I was going to be so bold as to pretentiously “announce” a
                        thing I’m doing to my 8 biggest fans (luv u), I should tack on the words “available in zine
                        format” to give it a reason to exist. </p>

                <p> Usually I can weasel my way out of any deadline I set myself. I have surrounded myself with patient
                        people (and gotten really good at going fast close to the finish line) to compensate. </p>

                <p> You can’t do this when the author of the game likes the promo announcement you made. Well, you can.
                        But it would be kind of lame wouldn’t it? </p>

                <p> I had always considered turning my reviews into zines. I run a zine jam for the discord server I
                        primarily hang out in, I hang out in zine distro spaces IRL, and I’ve always wanted to break
                        into the zone with something more focused. </p>

                <img onclick="window.open(this.src, '_blank');" src="assets/blog/0007-thekiller/Mobius.jpg" />

                <p> My previous experience was zines was making <a href="zines.html"><b><i>Mobius Loop</i></b></a>, a
                        companion zine for a small group of people doing a read-along for the Archie Sonic Comics. We
                        got all the way up to issue 50 in the span of 8 weeks, so me and Discord user Rist produced 7
                        weekly zines for people who were coming in late/wanted something to chew on. Primarily I did
                        character bios (do you know how many recurring characters there are in archie sonic. It cracks
                        100 before week 8, I’ll tell you that much) and cover art, as well as the general production of
                        the thing. Without this experience, I would never have the confidence to get ROTK out within the
                        12 day time frame I gave myself. </p>

                <p> It was shockingly late in the game I realized that I would *ONLY* make the review available in zine
                        format. The idea was to do a simultaneous release, which is something I even cheekily reference
                        in the review itself. I was going to try and keep the reviews different, but this was just too
                        much work, and all of my good ideas were best utilized in zine format. </p>

                <p> I scrapped the blog review and focused on making my dreams come true. </p>

                <p> Initially I knew LESS what the zine version would look like. I tried to draw on as much inspiration
                        from the source material as possible that laid within my own interests- what I eventually landed
                        on was this: </p>

                <img onclick="window.open(this.src, '_blank');" src="assets/blog/0007-thekiller/Highlights.jpg" />

                <p> You may remember these things. They always reeked of evil in some way. For what purpose are we
                        having the fun?? In every Doctors-Dentist-Barber waiting room was a pile of children’s
                        magazines- my mother would always comment how she fondly remembered highlights from HER
                        childhood. They are full of the most disappointing games and activities a child could ever
                        obtain. </p>

                <p> The goal was to try and do “highlights but evil and cool.” Nearly none of that initial push made it
                        into the final thing- I will definitely revisit this concept. The draw of the concept was
                        growing up in a barber shop and thumbing the same 8 issues of Highlights hidden underneath piles
                        of inappropriate men’s magazines- crosswords, where’s waldo, weird comics about morality and
                        goodness- things like that! </p>

                <p> The other clear idea: doing daily strips for AotK. A lot of people have drawn the line between the
                        games and comics as a medium- and they make up some of the sourced inspirations. My head always
                        drifted towards newspaper comic strips: their surrealness, the short stabbing nature of the
                        dialogue, the narration of the self, and their own entrenched love of the mundanely bizarre
                        crawls out of every episode in Anthology of the Killer. No, not the racist ones. God I cannot
                        tell you how much of a racist minefield old newspaper comics are. </p>

                <p> The art style also just reminds me of newspaper strips as well- the flat colors, the abstract
                        shapes, the enjoyable to construct figures for your main characters- it all just clicked into
                        place. Also, newspaper strips where were I fell in love with ink in the first place, so it
                        seemed like a natural inclusion. </p>

                <p> Oh yeah, almost all the art is hand drawn in this thing, including the trim. Let’s talk about that.
                </p>

                <img onclick="window.open(this.src, '_blank');" src="assets/blog/0007-thekiller/Process.png" />

                <p> So some background: I practice physical ink because I am a coward with using a tablet. Until about a
                        year ago every line I could draw stank of misery. That’s no longer the case! I got to a level I
                        feel comfy at now! The idea of starting that process over again with the temptation of an undo
                        button does not appeal to me. So yes: I promise I’m not a luddite!!! Yes, I see you about to
                        point out how they were cool actually. I know this!! I’m not cool either!!!!!!! </p>

                <p> Color is actually new to me, fun fact. I’m primarily an inker, and my plan was to digitally color
                        all of my pieces starting from around last June- but a chance encounter with some alcohol
                        markers delayed that from happening. So I have a 2 step process: do the line art on paper, copy
                        that with a laser printer, and then use alcohol markers to color that in for a clean scan. I
                        digitally touch up the black tones to offset the darkness that a scanner often infects drawings
                        with, and BAM. Finished image. See below for some examples and memorabilia of my process. </p>

                <p class="caption"> The alcohol markers bleed thru my printer paper, so I have a stack of papers to
                        catch the ink. I kept this all on </p>

                <p class="caption"> All of the teaser originals. I acutally don’t know what to do with these… they will
                        essentially stay in storage, and i’m not sure how many people keep a PO box to receive art
                        crudely mailed on stock printer paper… </p>

                <img onclick="window.open(this.src, '_blank');" src="assets/blog/0007-thekiller/Process3.jpg" />

                <p class="caption"> So I don’t use Copics, because i dont have bajillions of boondollars… these are
                        Ohuhu markers, which are also really nice and cost me less. Truthfully I didnt buy them, and
                        therefore I don’t know anything about them, other than that they are in fact quite nice to use.
                        This is every color I used for the production of the zine. </p>

                <img onclick="window.open(this.src, '_blank');"
                        src="assets/blog/0007-thekiller/College_Kids_Sketch.jpg" />

                <p class="caption"> Original Scan of the lineart, untreated. You can see the ink isnt hyper solid
                        everywhere. Normally I don’t scan these, but I photocopy them because I have a laser printer
                        that makes a crisp black that DOESNT lift when I use my markers. </p>

                <img onclick="window.open(this.src, '_blank');"
                        src="assets/blog/0007-thekiller/College_Kids_Color.jpg" />

                <p class="caption"> Original Scan of the colored piece. As with all art, the colors get a bit squashed
                        going from Real Eye Vision to RGB colorspace (the way a computer screen displays it (except your
                        iphone sometimes, which yes can deal with color spaces that are slightly bigger than 8 bit, its
                        complicated)) So yes, the colors I eyeball have to translate to the computer, then translate to
                        print (which is in CYMK, and even more restrictive color space). The biggest example is the
                        “orange” used here: it’s actually salmon in real life, and looks frighteningly light. </p>

                <p> Above is the final, processed image. No, its not just that its a transparent PNG- I isolate the
                        black lines from the image in GIMP, and then I bump up the contrast to sharpen the lines to
                        actual pure black. I’m a stickler for lines that don’t grey out, and the scanner attached to my
                        printer tends to blow out black lines to almost grey. Am I being a bit of a perfectionist here?
                        Sure. But let me show you a different example of what my scans used to look like BEFORE I bumped
                        up the contrast: </p>

                <img onclick="window.open(this.src, '_blank');" src="assets/blog/0007-thekiller/Floigan.jpg" />

                <p class="caption">Yes. this is about the Floigan Brothers. That whole pet fascination is a whole other
                        conversation lol</p>

                <p> Look at that. you could smell the amateur. It would look so much nicer If I bumped up the contrast.
                        It’s true that it’s more obvious that my stuff is hand drawn, but maybe not in a good way here.
                </p>

                <p> Anyways… </p>

                <p> Now normally when I’m working quick, I usually use a lighting system with extreme white highlights.
                        My grip on lighting is currently “vibes based” so don’t learn any lessons from me. Anthology of
                        the Killer uses flat vibrant colors with generally environmental mood lighting over any explicit
                        volume based lighting for its characters- generally speaking, the characters revel in their
                        flatness. I wanted to lean into this, so I eliminated the contrast bright tones. Looking back, I
                        regret this a bit- it just had the effect of making my own personal drawings look a little bit
                        flat. But maybe I’m wrong! Peep the comparison below and form your own opinions! </p>

                <p> Most of the line art was done with zebra brush pens, which are my go-to as far as disposables go. I
                        have also used various brush pens of the bristle variety and wow: for some reason, a terrible
                        mildew infected my newest brushes, which made several parts of it (and other brushes I owned)
                        unusable!!! It was awful. Going forward, I’m just going to commit to dip brushes so I can clean
                        everything in between uses… </p>

                <p> Perhaps the last thing to talk about is the teasers. I suppose I should collect them all so they’re
                        in one place. Feel free to click through them- You can see that the backgrounds (which were
                        generated with various rendering tools in GIMP) got a little better everytime. Fun fact: the
                        last one turned out so good that I ended up using it for the Zine’s Itch preview- Marcies shadow
                        is actually what makes the inner little spooky spiral, so you can still see a portion of her
                        figure looming over bb. IDK if anyone can see it, but that particular character dynamic is very
                        important to me… </p>

                <p> The truth is that I never expected these drawings to draw a crowd. I wanted to do these daily
                        teasers because I thought it was a funny joke to take my work seriously as if it had people
                        sitting there, waiting for it. I guess you can just sort of wish that crowd into existence????
                </p>

                <p> In particular, I cannot thank enough <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/circadianrhythmofthekiller">Daily of The Killer</a>, a
                        daily art blog who found my teasers early on and more or less helped promote the whole thing
                        while cheering me on. Looking at their art early on pushed me to really do a good job with my
                        semi-daily teasers and the zine in general. Also thank you to thecatamites (main dev of
                        anthology of the killer, although I’m sure you know that) for sharing the zine on the day of
                        release. It meant a lot to me!!!!!! </p>

                <p> Also, as you can count, I am missing some days. here are some assets I made to fill in some of the
                        missing days… try and guess which image is exhaustively popular, and which one is not. </p>

                <p> While I had the basic ideas of the activities for the zine, the review itself was tough to crack. I
                        had written chunks at disparate times, and I found I had my arms tied in regard to length,
                        specificity, and flow. Not only are the OF THE KILLER games hyper approachable, but they’re also
                        episodic and modest in length. It is a pristine package that punches you in the gut. The problem
                        is that for the purpose of a review, technically the sentence I just wrote is all you need. In
                        fact, i’m pretty sure it’s the exact steam review I left. </p>

                <p> I usually like to write about games that have been around for some time because I love to write
                        about games in depth- when it comes to smaller indie games that truly touch me, my primary
                        concerns less so dissection and more so getting everyone else to share the experience with me.
                        More people should play these games, and the worst thing you can do with a review trying to
                        accomplish this is to do the thing where the guy at the party tells you about how great a show
                        is by repeating all the jokes badly at you. You can avoid that, but a dissection can wrongly
                        give the air that “I have played the game for you.” I have not. You go do that, now if you
                        somehow still haven’t. Yes I’m talking to you. Make me some tea while you’re at it. </p>

                <p> The goal shifts- the remaining aim is to describe the game perfectly without describing it entirely.
                        Normally my reviews tend to have some semblance of flow (like most prose). I am most motivated
                        to write when I have an interesting structure to base the piece out of.
                        <a href="blog-0002-pikmin.html"> My Pikmin 4 review</a>, for instance, is broken into 5
                        parts that aim to approximate the tone and vibes of the original 5 levels of Pikmin 1, despite
                        the piece not being about that at all. 
                        <a href="blog-0002-pikmin.html">It’s a good review by the way, you should read it.</a> </p>

                <p> For a long time I struggled with a structure for this piece. I had sketches of writing with clear
                        distinct goals but could never marry their ends and beginnings to eachother. I am a big fan of
                        breaking an analysis into big obvious sections for pacing reasons, but the writing I had felt
                        too episodic. At that point I realized the game I was reviewing was an anthology of episodes,
                        and that I had already been jokingly calling each section “___ of the Killer.” From here, the
                        review finished itself, as I no longer had to work to stitch together the individual blurbs I
                        had written. </p>

                <p> I’m ultimately glad I went with this- I think it enhanced the feeling of the final zine. Page turns
                        naturally disguise non sequitur breaks in your writing, it turns out. </p>

                <p> Of course, while the text was written, the visual elements quickly took form. There were a few
                        things I needed to keep in mind and avoid: </p>

                <p> 1. The promo art I produced would be repurposed throughout the book, and the remainder would be
                        presented as “paper dolls.” Its fine to present art as is and many do it- but it feels alien to
                        me personally. I tend to use art as a pace breaker for long articles, or as some sort of
                        artifact. Even though all I was doing was writing a blurb and putting dotted lines around the
                        art, it felt like a fun way to get people to remember the art. One IRL friend would tell me the
                        paper dolls were her favorite part- I have mixed feelings on this sentiment, but that is how all
                        art goes, isn’t it? People love you in surprising ways, and I try to think it best to not ask
                        too many questions. Only cops ask too many fucking questions. The paper dolls idea was one of
                        those that made the zine doable- I could even have up to 2 blank pages to use in case the page
                        count was off. oh yeah, </p>

                <p> 2. <b>THIS ZINE NEEDS TO BE PRINTABLE IN BOOKLET FORMAT.</b> More on this later, but the biggest
                        requirement is that you must have a page number divisible by 4. Let me tell you: the difference
                        between 20 and 24 pages is ROUGH. One page over 20, and now you have 4 pages over 20. This is
                        made worse by: </p>

                <p> 3. <b>THE PAPER DOLLS PAGE NEEDS TO BE ON THE CENTER FOLD.</b> That means in my 20 page zine, pages
                        9-12 were mostly taken, 10-11 esp. If people were gonna cut up the zine, I needed them to
                        theoretically be able to remove the page. This quickly became a pain because: </p>

                <p> 4. <b>THE DAILY COMIC STRIPS NEEDED TO BE LATER IN THE REVIEW ACROSS A 2 PAGE SPREAD.</b> I came up
                        really early on with the idea for Wednesday, titled “The Big Day.” I knew in general I didn’t
                        want to give people an impression of the character BB at all without first talking about some of
                        the core details of the game. One more problem: </p>

                <p> 5. <b>AVOIDING DUMPING ALL THE ACTIVITIES IN THE CENTER OF THE MAGAZINE.</b> I always hated how
                        children’s magazines did this- it felt like your fun and games were being excised from the body
                        of the magazine itself, and I’d rather have some of the “fun” breaking up some of the sections.
                        I would fail this because: </p>

                <p> 6. <b>THE ORDER OF THE TEXT SECTIONS ARE PRE-DETERMINED.</b> Yeah, I had no flexibility here, with a
                        one page section sort of disrupting the math of the whole thing. It was a nightmare, and so I
                        ended up cutting some content and putting the comics and paper dolls next to each other. Drat.
                </p>

                <p> 7. <b>I NEED TO BE ABLE TO PRINT THIS IN BOTH A4 and LETTERHEAD, MARGINLESS OR MARGINMORE.</b> Okay,
                        its worth examining how I did this: </p>

                <img onclick="window.open(this.src, '_blank');" src="assets/blog/0007-thekiller/Shape.png" />

                <p> I have never worked in a copy shop and it shows. All of the people i know that are REAL paper heads
                        have cut their teeth on toner tubes and the worst lights corporate could buy. I had to figure
                        out all this paper shit on my own, and it was a lot of misery and error. Did I mention I’m
                        number blind? So there’s that, too. </p>

                <img onclick="window.open(this.src, '_blank');" src="assets/blog/0007-thekiller/Paper.png" />

                <p> For those not in the know, there are two common paper standards. A4 is a nice sizing scheme, where
                        folding it in half hamburger style makes a paper shape that has the SAME ratio as the pre-folded
                        paper (this would in fact be called A5). It’s really convenient so it should surprise nobody
                        that Americans don’t use it. We use letterhead, which is 8.5”x11”. This is slightly stouter and
                        MUCH shorter compared to A4’s 8.27”x 11.69.” So basically: letterhead is short and stout, while
                        A4 is tall and skinny. </p>

                <p> Except we don’t care about that. This is a folded booklet, so actually we’re working with half
                        letterhead (5.5” x 8.5” ) and A5 (5.85ish”x 8.27”). The roles are now reversed: Half letterhead
                        is the tall and skinny one, while A5 is pretty dang wide. Fun fact, you may have noticed half
                        letterhead is half the dimensions (so 1/4 the area (don’t ask)) of 11”x17”, a real paper size
                        you can buy called tabloid. You might think that’s a convenient feature, but in reality tabloid
                        is just 2 letterhead papers stuck together side by side- which means its half size becomes a 1/4
                        size of the new Frankenstein paper. This is true of all paper, of any size. Double it, and its
                        half now becomes its quarter. Make sense? No? Oh yeah, this is my robosona, which is me So
                        what’s it gonna be? Huh? HUH????? </p>

                <img onclick="window.open(this.src, '_blank');" src="assets/blog/0007-thekiller/Grinch.jpg" />

                <p> Anyways, with that in mind I had to structure my pages so that way all of the text and general cool
                        stuff in the trim fit 1/8th” from the smallest dimensions of both pages (so in 5.375” x 8.145”
                        box). Then, I had to make a trim that would fill the space from the borders of BOTH sizes
                        largest dimension (IE 5.85”x8.27”). The reason I had to redo all versions was that I had ALSO
                        forgot the 1/8” around all sides required for printing margin less prints, which means I had to
                        resize all border elements to fit into a 5.975” x 8.395” box. </p>

                <p> So here’s where I confess something that seems to make other artists feel atlas-load worths of pity:
                        I primarily use gimp for the Contruction of these things. I use it because Its simple to use
                        with a limited feature set, general works, and also because I have sworn I will never touch an
                        adobe product. Just pirate it? I refuse. Piracy is cool, but I’ll be damned if continue to live
                        in a world where everyone is using photoshop so all questions you might have will just point to
                        some nebulous photoshop feature. We have free software!! I’m going to stick to that instead,
                        power be damned. Yes, you can send me my medal in the mail. </p>

                <p> Basically: I generate a SINGLE gimp file set to 600 ppi (welcome to the modern storage age) at
                        5.975” x 8.395”. Then I drew a trim and tried to fit it so It would indicate the safety box in
                        the center- this meant I had to eyeball the paper dolls page. If I was thinking, I would make
                        separate layers that ONLY extended to the safety box size, but here we are. </p>

                <p> I organized the trim into different layers in a group, and then would create layer groups for each
                        page. This would contain things like the title, the text, any extra assets that might lie
                        within. Once all that labor was done, I would essentially Export the files as PNGs (flattening
                        the assets and text) one page at a time, turning on and off the basic trim elements at will- you
                        see this with the “of the KILLER” title, that’s how it ends up in the same spot every time. I
                        like to think its a little like those huge animation camera towers where you had cells on
                        different layer levels, and you’d arrange everything and take pictures with different setups.
                </p>

                <p> Once I had these grossly oversized PNGs, I combined and converted these pages into a single PDF,
                        then simply opened that pdf in gimp. Resizing them for A5 and half Letterhead is easy from here-
                        you already did all the work with the margins! When you open a pdf in gimp, it opens them as
                        individual layers at whatever ppi you set (I chose 600 ppi to preserve the original quality).
                        Then, I simply changed the “image canvas size” to the desired size of A5 or half letterhead and
                        watched as every layer was resized. Then I simply exported it as a PDF again, making sure to
                        check the box “treat layers as separate pages.” Fun fact, I did not do this for the letterhead
                        version on release, so it instead layered all 20 pages as one layer, and PDFs are annoying in
                        that they don’t naturally flatten themselves, but instead treat this as 20 assets stacked on top
                        of each other. </p>

                <p> By the way- this is a way for YOU to make zines and make them globally available. I should make a
                        zine about this. I will make a zine about this- but you should take this advice already start
                        making shit now. I like reading peoples shit! Send it! No really- I will read anything you send
                        me. I am just sort of like that. </p>

                <p> So some stuff got cut. </p>

                <p> The biggest thing that got cut was SUNDAY of the KILLER- the original plan was to do a whole week of
                        comics. It was cut due to time limitations- the idea of drawing a rainforest cafe reveal in the
                        last big panel was always in the cards. The Sunday format is an infamously choking layout
                        requirement for newspapers to geometrically cut up your strip for page layouts, including a
                        large chunk of your comic required to be a literal “throwaway gag.” I really wanted to complete
                        it- even for these bonus features- but I couldn’t. It was just a victim of time and execution.
                        My general setup was BB going on a bad friend finding date thru an app, and for the final gag to
                        be a zoom out of beautifully rendered Rainforest cafe interior (because yes. I did know who Cha
                        Cha the frog was, i was in fact one of those kids who studied menus and character biographies
                        like it was a tasty treat). The thing I couldn’t square was BB getting on these apps- it just
                        felt to antithetical to the BB presented. Always the doer, never the wanter. There’s a really
                        good Ace reading in Heart of the Killer, and I’ve always tried to keep that in mind and not put
                        BB in those situations. IDK. This is just my own thoughts, keep in mind I literally just showed
                        you a picture of the weepster and blue d hands getting mad sloppy. </p>

                <p> The other reason it was cut was because it turns out that both half letterhead and a4 are TERRIBLE
                        for comic strips, Sunday or otherwise. This is why book collections are frequently printed in
                        strange yet beautiful shapes. If you go back and examine Monday-Saturday, you might notice the
                        text is absurdly large for most strips- its because I knew the size ratio for comic strips would
                        severely limit their readability when shrunk. The Sunday format, which is printed with 4 rows
                        vertically, would have been a tiny disappointment. Maybe make a better one than I would have as
                        an exercise. </p>

                <img onclick="window.open(this.src, '_blank');" src="assets/blog/0007-thekiller/Goofus.jpg" />

                <p class="caption">Courtesy Highlights Magazine, you puritanically adjacent magazine you</p>

                <p> What also got cut were more goofus and gallant parody strips. Goofus and Gallant are a recurring
                        chick-tract-meets-family-circus type deal that teaches morality and manners- Goofus is a jerk,
                        where gallant is beloved by all. When I did the teasers, I made sure that all the episodes would
                        be represented in some way except for one: I never drew morality animal. I really like morality
                        animal. Like a lot!!! It was only natural I wanted to do a full page of goofus and gallant
                        shenanigans starring the other character I hadn’t drawn much, ZZ. I feel like she’s sort of a
                        cool and confident delinquent anyways. You only got one strip due to similar time constraints.
                </p>

                <p> Fun fact: The text actually does say garbled versions of real things I’ve heard that annoy me
                        personally. No, I won’t tell you what they are. Have fun decoding. </p>

                <img class="bigimg" onclick="window.open(this.src, '_blank');"
                        src="assets/blog/0007-thekiller/Comic1.png" />

                <p> While we’re on the subject of the comics, let’s talk about voices: I feel bad about having to kind
                        of “fill in the gaps” with BB. Part of BB’s character is this omnipresent narration and a sort
                        of stoic stability of self (which is a bit ironic given the uncertainty that is at the core of
                        the character). This is my read of her of course, but that’s the thing about writing a character
                        that isn’t yours: you’re going to bring yourself to it, and it’s going to change the character.
                        I wasn’t able to make the narration work for 3 panel strips, and so I had to actually convey BB
                        a little more passively than I’d like. </p>

                <img onclick="window.open(this.src, '_blank');" src="assets/blog/0007-thekiller/Comic2.png" />

                <p> “the big day” is probably the riskiest of the strips. It was aimed at people who haven’t played the
                        game yet to try and hint a deeper mood at the games core than it or my writing lets on, but
                        ultimately It isn’t really the kind of thing you’d see in the game itself, and maybe is a bit
                        more personal than I’d let on. My justification is simple: I think everyone has had a bad thing
                        like this happen. What it is, I won’t tell you, because deep down you already know. </p>

                <p> Perhaps in truth, it is more about what happened to me to make this game speak so deep to me. It
                        also was merely a simple evolution of “how can I make a joke about drawing BB in the same pose 3
                        identical times.” </p>

                <p> As far as other cut content: I was supposed to draw a teaser of BD HANS Kissing the weepster. It was
                        going to be rendered in full sloppy color. Please enjoy looking at the sketch of it one last
                        time. </p>

                <img class="bigimg" onclick="window.open(this.src, '_blank');"
                        src="assets/blog/0007-thekiller/Yaoi.webp" />

                <p> I also planned to do a simple waldo tribute. You cannot “simply” do waldo. It has to be in color and
                        it has to be big and it has to be beautiful. It would have taken me as long as it took me to do
                        the whole zine as it would take do a waldo. </p>

                <p> I also thought about doing a LIFE style board game removable but decided against that because its
                        kind of its own good idea. Feel free to steal that idea. Feel free to steal any ideas. I think
                        making that bad of a Kathy Aker pun legally requires me to say that. </p>

                <p> By the way: I was looking for places to sell the zine in the real world and wouldn’t you know it:
                        the person asking the same question indicated they stumbled into the world of underground zines
                        via podcast discussing Cathy the comic strip- did someone beam this into my head? Is Cathy
                        making a comebACK? Did I miss out on the new wave Cathy???????????? </p>

                <p> Anyways, I also failed to come up with a puzzle that was funnier than the murder crossword that’s in
                        the zine that comes with the game. </p>

                <p> Oh yeah, did you read the zine that comes with your game? Check your files and print it yourself-
                        its good! Although if you’re American you’re going to have to do some cutting unless u like big
                        margins… a suitable tax. </p>

                <img onclick="window.open(this.src, '_blank');" src="assets/blog/0007-thekiller/Horizons.png" />

                <p> So what’s next for me? You’ve gotten to the end of my post, there is a good chance that at this
                        point you care about my creative outpost in some way. </p>

                <p> Here’s what Is on my plate commitment wise: </p>

                <p> - The third Goblin Bunker ZINE JAM is underway RIGHT NOW. If you want to join, Here is a link{} to
                        the discord. Its not mine, so behave. Seriously. The zine jam’s theme this time is more or less
                        game emulation and piracy, but there is a lot of flexibility there. Trust me, I like it when
                        people defy the boundaries placed upon them! </p>

                <p> - I have to draw the covers and do character bios/work for the return of MOBIUS LOOP, an archie
                        sonic read-along supplement fanzine I run with Discord User Rist, who i think has literally no
                        social media. Good for you rist… you are safe from my shilling for now. </p>

                <p> - I’m gonna do a bunch of art. I’m trying to be good so I can do commissions on time for people,
                        because I like drawing things for people and I like the idea that those drawings could buy me
                        more art supplies/ money for prints. </p>

                <p> - I’m going to experiment with riso. don’t expect me to sell stickers or riso prints of Anthology of
                        the Killer because I wouldn’t dare do that without permission for a more niche game… Idk. I feel
                        weird about that sort of thing in this case. I only say that because the sticker thing has been
                        pointed out to me privately, and I have had to really ruminate on it. </p>

                <p> - I have to finish a very simple game sometime start of the next calendar year. It will be a fun
                        diversion for you, I hope. </p>

                <p> - I will be finishing a really long story about the three different original Mcdonalds, the
                        mythology of business, and the damage we do when we all pretend that corporations didn’t usurp
                        global infrastructure. I’m not sure I can fit that into a zine, but maybe it’ll just be really
                        thick. Who knows. Its been in my pocket for a while now… </p>

                <p> - Maybe someday I will finish that Floigan brothers comic. I’m not kidding. </p>

                <p> - I will in fact revisit Anthology of the Killer to do analysis after some time passes… there is a
                        lot to unpack, and I want people to play the game first before I do so. </p>

                <p> - The next 2 review zines will be about 2 games near and dear to my heart… 24 Killers and Before the
                        Green Moon. Pick them up and play them right now if you’re thirsty for a new experience to chew
                        on. </p>

                <p> My final words: Thanks for sticking with me. Scrolling down here shows you care, and I greatly
                        appreciate it. If you really liked my zine and want people to play the game, maybe send them my
                        review if they like reading. Truly this isn’t something I made for people who enjoyed the game:
                        I want this out in the world giving people an insight to something new. I’m not kidding. If you
                        make a bunch of money printing and selling my zine for your booth at a fest somewhere, think
                        nothing of it. You just made me happy because hopefully someone saw a game review zine and
                        thought “wow I could and should do that!” </p>

                <p> Thank you for reading.
