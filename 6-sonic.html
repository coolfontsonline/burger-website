                <p>
                        I’ll be brief: I don’t think people who analyze Sonic speak to the game’s strengths (or
                        weaknesses) properly.
                        While I do not have the energy in me to dissect the game with a surgeon’s pedigree,
                        I do have the time to speak to the pathing design in Sonic games.
                        Conventional wisdom and most armchair analysis decrees that
                        “cool people take the top routes; the bottom routes are where players start by default.”
                        This isn’t remotely true but feels true to anyone who has played Aquatic Ruins Zone in Sonic 2.
                        Many will cite this same pattern to the Sonic 1 Zones!

                        <br><br>
                        None of this is true. At best, it’s a simplification.

                        <br><br>
                        Sonic’s path design isn’t *too* complex,
                        but there are distinct flavors of different paths.
                        Today, we will look at the maps of Sonic levels to analyze and refute the idea that Sonic even
                        *has* a homogenous level design approach,
                        let alone one that was cemented as early as the first game.
                        I have created new assets for our study and leave matters of subjectivity as an exercise for the
                        reader (you).

                        <br><br>
                        As an aside: Please forgive the slightly lower standards of writing on display in this article.
                        This was a challenge to write something shorter in a week.
                        I’m still working on longer pieces (there is a really good one in the chamber about the first
                        Mcdonalds),
                        but you may see smaller (and hopefully better) installations on this blog in the future.

                        <br><br>
                        Before we get to the analysis, some things you should know about Sonic 1:

                        <br><br>
                        <b>There is no Spindashing in this game.</b> You had to gain speed by using slopes and rolling
                        to your advantage.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>You do not gain speed by running.</b> Running for about 2ish seconds is enough to get you top
                        speed,
                        and jumping can get you there even faster. The main reason for this is
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Sonic 1 has a unique and aggressive Speed Cap. </b>
                        If you are running and so much as *touch* a direction on the controller,
                        the game immediately subtracts all speed over the very low cap and returns you to a slow chug.
                        That means if you run down a steep hill, you run down it at a near constant slow rate. T
                        his sounds wrong if you have played a port of Sonic 1 or its sequels- no other iteration of
                        sonic features the speed cap in the same way.
                        This ensures that in Sonic 1, you HAVE to roll in order to exceed the speed cap.

                        <br><br>
                        <b>With that, on with the analysis! All sprites used are sourced from here.</b>
                        <br><br>

                <h2>GREEN HILL ZONE</h2>
                <p>Sonic 1 does not feature a save battery and was therefore designed with hard game-overs in mind. Lose
                        all your lives (and continues if you have them) and it was back to the start for you! This means
                        the first few levels (the first Zone in particular) needed to be polished to perfection, as well
                        as constantly challenge and tutorialize the player on skills required to beat the entire game.
                        Most know this, but I didn’t want this to be absent from an analysis, as today we will see how
                        Green Hill Zone offers players novel and returning a decent (but controlled) variety of paths to
                        traverse the levels. </p>

                <h3>Green Hill Zone: ACT 1</h3>
                <img onclick="window.open(this.src, '_blank');" src="images/articles/6-sonic/GHZ1_Lines.png" />
                <p>In the minds of all new Sonic players, Act 1 exists only on the white lines- it is no coincidence
                        then, that this is the most fun and iconic section of Sonic. The only insight to add that I have
                        is the liberal use of one way paths- they definitely wanted to ensure you kept moving toward the
                        exit rather than double back. The lowest path (for players who dared not jump into the spring to
                        the higher white path) skips the red path entirely. You will see that sometimes I mark a large
                        collection of rings as an item- I hope you would agree with my decision.
                        <br><br>
                        Below is an abstractification of the above line chart- I simply condense the shapes into circles
                        and ignore any spatial arrangement that does not meaningfully contribute to the path branching.
                        I do this analysis often on map focused games, so hopefully you find them useful abstractions as
                        well. Please note I have cut off the beginning linear section for clarity.
                        <img onclick="window.open(this.src, '_blank');" src="images/articles/6-sonic/GHZ1_Circles.webp" />

                <h3>Green Hill Zone: ACT 2</h3>
                <img onclick="window.open(this.src, '_blank');" src="images/articles/6-sonic/GHZ2_Lines.png" />
                <p>It is worth pointing out that my judgment for a “higher skill floor required for entry” is entirely
                        subjective. Perhaps you see taking the swinging platform over the spikes as “trivial,” but to a
                        novel player it may be insurmountable. As the stages progress, so does general expectations for
                        competency. Often, It makes sense to mark the “harder” path as a red one, even if the difference
                        is only by barely. I’m aiming for analytical clarity, not objective judgment.
                        <br><br>
                        Act 2 introduces a blue path, albeit a very small one. I tested it out- it’s pretty hard if
                        you’re just holding right to fall in that pit. It’s a longer path to the exit, but there ARE a
                        few items. It also features a small tutorial on secret walls at the start- there is a monitor
                        placed just up against a miscolored wall. Rolling thru the monitor at a high enough speed is
                        enough to reveal the secret. These will feature more prominently in the next level!
                        <br><br>
                        Looking at the graph below, it’s clear they more explicitly want the player to have
                        opportunities to engage with alternate paths- the main path through is noticeably windier.
                </p>

                <h3>Green Hill Zone: ACT 3</h3>
                <img onclick="window.open(this.src, '_blank');" src="images/articles/6-sonic/GHZ3_Lines.png" />
                <p>This is it- this is the blueprint for Sonic level design in an easy to digest, linear format. While
                        many tend to oversimplify in describing “high path rules, low path drools,” you merely have
                        different options for different sort of players. There is even spicy section along the blue path
                        that dumps a staggering number of goodies if players take a leap of faith just before exiting
                        the blue path.
                        <br><br>
                        This stage has the most checkpoints of any stage. Interestingly, players who favor the hidden
                        blue path skip the first freebie checkpoint. As a counterpoint, the red path is given its own
                        special checkpoint so players will be forced to try and keep the high ground should they
                        (somehow) die. It’s possible! But very unlikely.
                        <br><br>
                        Modern design (and by Modern, I mean the Master System version of Sonic the Hedgehog did this)
                        would make Act 3 the shortest one (since it features a boss), but instead it is the largest
                        level yet.
                        <br><br>
                        Perhaps more interesting: nothing in any of these stages (including the red path!) requires
                        rolling, let alone competent rolling. There are 3 different clear forks to the red path, and 2
                        different blue path alternatives. If you feel like you don’t remember Act 3 clearly, it might be
                        that you took a myriad of different routes! There are very few strictly linear portions of this
                        level (the longest one being the secret blue path, interestingly). If I were do some armchair
                        level design, I would stick like 2 ring boxes in that lower path.
                        <br><br>
                        Final thing: There are 4 different hidden (blue) items, half of which are on the red path. While
                        more common in later Sonic games, you won’t be seeing camouflaged items for a long while in
                        Sonic 1!
                        <br><br>
                        Looking at the simplified map below, we see the first major instance of taking one alternative
                        path blocking a player out from opportunities to take other paths! Decisions like these help the
                        level feel varied across multiple playthroughs, rather than a simple “one path is cool, the
                        other is lame.”

                <h2>MARBLE ZONE</h2>
                <p>You know this zone. I know this zone. It’s got a great tune, and everyone hates playing it. I won’t
                        repeat what others say, I will instead show you:</p>
                <h3>Marble Zone: Act 1</h3>
                <img onclick="window.open(this.src, '_blank');" src="images/articles/6-sonic/MZ1_Lines.png" />
                <p>It’s sobering, isn’t it? Remember what I said about the red lines being subjective? I had to make the
                        same decisions about the slightly “hidden” item boxes near the start. Remember, this is a game
                        made for children, and we’re only in the second act.
                        <br><br>
                        (by children I mean literally four year olds. Children are much smarter than this)
                        <br><br>
                        It’s tiny, but keep in mind the stage is designed to make you wait for hazards and lava boats.
                        If someone looks at this map and tells me “If you’re super cool you can go fast!” then please
                        understand that I am mainly concerned with the path design.
                        <br><br>
                        A friend of mine told me “What a lovely painting of some tress you made.” If only.
                </p>

                <h3>Marble Zone: Act 2</h3>
                <img onclick="window.open(this.src, '_blank');" src="images/articles/6-sonic/MZ2_Lines.png" />
                <p>Since we are looking at an even more dire straight line to the end, I may as well clarify something:
                        <br><br>
                        Often, amateurs will discuss game design from a specific angle (such as path design) only to
                        make foolish statements such as “Look at how linear this level is! That’s why it’s bad!”
                        Linearity is not inherently bad- perhaps nothing truly is. I will instead talk about specific
                        things I notice, as sweeping statements about “objective quality” bore me.
                        <br><br>
                        This level gives you a lot of items. There are 4 different lava pits to slowly wade through,
                        half of them can be traversed at speed with either good skill or good item usage. It is
                        unremarkable. I don’t mean that as a judgment, I am literally struggling to remark on it.
                        <br><br>
                        I was going to use SMB1 levels as a bastion of linear levels, but most levels in Super Mario
                        Bros. feature secret pipes that will then warp players to different spots forwards (or sometimes
                        backwards!) in a level. What I am trying to say is that following Green Hill Zone 3, two zones
                        of repeated linearity is a bit shocking, especially since Act 2 is merely a longer version of
                        Act 1 structurally.
                        <br><br>
                        The simplified version does confirm that yes- this is simply act 1 with more stuff in it.
                </p>

                <p>While the blue path is appreciated, it is actually the slower way through the level with zero items
                        to boot…. interesting choice! If I was still offering level design edits (a thing I used to do
                        years ago for a few hundred or so people) I would have zoomed in on that sort of thing- you
                        don’t have to explicitly reward the player for putting in effort for something, but you should
                        be mindful to completely fail to acknowledge effort!
                        <br><br>
                        Some have objected with my decision to label the blue path here as “secret”- but keep in mind,
                        the blue path takes more effort to enter, even if miniscule. When we’re talking about a level at
                        this low of a complexity, any decision on delineation becomes tough.
                        <br><br>
                        The simplified version confirms that yes, Act 3 IS a slightly more interesting version of the
                        other 2 acts. Are we done now?

                <h2>SPRING YARD ZONE</h2>
                <p>Perhaps you remember this zone being fun, and maybe you have even made the mistake of committing the
                        armchair analyst’s sin of using a designers hammer so much you see every problem as a nail
                        <a href="turtle.html">(or an image of a turtle, in my case)</a>
                        : you might have falsely assumed Spring Yard Zone features A LOT of alternate paths to take. It
                        offers more than zero, sure, but it is by all means very linear! There is a reason for this, and
                        there is a reason you remember it as fun:
                        <br><br>
                        Spring Yard functions as a tutorial on how to *actually* go fast in Sonic 1. The zone teaches
                        you about rolling on slopes, rolling into springs, and gaining height in half pipe formations.
                        In fact, the levels eventually require you doing some of these skills competently in order to
                        proceed. Let’s see how that looks!
                </p>

                <h3>Spring Yard Zone: ACT 1</h3>
                <img onclick="window.open(this.src, '_blank');" src="images/articles/6-sonic/SYZ1_Lines.png" />
                <p>Act 1 is the first stage to force players to climb large vertical spaces quickly. Marble Zone was
                        technically more vertical, but slower and more staircasey. The level starts out with having to
                        use the springs to ascend 2 different ramps.
                        <br><br>
                        Another key thing about these ramps: You must roll up the hills, or you will not make it up.
                        <br><br>
                        We finally have to talk about the innerworkings of Sonic 1: You have two states: running and
                        rolling. Running in Sonic 1 is the slow option. Running is easier to control, but the game
                        (unlike later entries) will aggressively cap your speed to a speed that could barely ascend
                        shallow ramps. Rolling removed all caps on speed, but your inputs would turn into mere
                        suggestions (ignored until thrown into the air altogether).
                        <br><br>
                        You may be wondering about that green line- to take the green path, you must press the button,
                        turn around, and jump on the platform before it ascends. This feels too esoteric for a regular
                        blue path, so I colored it differently! This level has little more to point out in words, as
                        once you pass the tutorial section, Act 1 is mostly interested in familiarizing you with its
                        enemies and hazards. It still has some hidden shortcuts for interested players!
                </p>

                <h3>Spring Yard Zone: ACT 2</h3>
                <img onclick="window.open(this.src, '_blank');" src="images/articles/6-sonic/SYZ2_Lines.png" />
                <p>Act 2 attempts to teach the player about rolling’s unique speedy properties, as well its potential
                        for gaining height (Sonic jumps higher the faster he is going. one of those things in
                        platformers you just don’t explicitly think about). The near stage-spanning ramp in the middle
                        is the biggest chance the player has to freely roll with nothing to impede them.
                        <br><br>
                        The blue path in Act 2 is the first one I would describe as “massively hidden”, as it requires
                        walking through a false wall. It only exists for players who fail to roll up to the first red
                        path (or instinctively descend to see what path they missed). I kind of think they may have
                        stuck the blue path in for players who ascend the first red path, come to the interesting
                        descending blocks, and fall blindly backwards? If I were to armchair design this level, I would
                        have made the top of the moving block tower a one-way floor- but perhaps this approach is more
                        versatile and more interesting! I’m still afraid of the inevitable player who takes that bottom
                        path backwards and gets potentially frustrated.
                        <br><br>
                        Once you’re past the big ramp, this stage *finally* brings back skill challenges, with multiple
                        opportunities to ascend to the higher path. There’s nothing up there, but it is fun! They even
                        threw in a second goal ring as a way to reward players who succeed (or fail) to make the ramp
                        jump at the end of the stage.
                        <br><br>
                        Looking at the simple version below, it is clear to these big set pieces broken up with smaller
                        divots and secrets. There is always an interesting choice forward! What you don’t see is a lot
                        of path lockout. I suspect this is what makes the Spring Yard Acts feel a bit simpler than their
                        Green Hill counterparts- you have circle after circle after circle, always returning to a nice
                        pinch point. Perhaps you noticed: the tutorials in this stage are so important that they decided
                        to give no checkpoints!
                </p>

                <img onclick="window.open(this.src, '_blank');" src="images/articles/6-sonic/SYZ3_Lines.png" />
                <p>This stage is yet another tutorial level, which tests you on utilizing ball physics to gain height UP
                        ramps.
                        <br><br>
                        However: What looks like a coherent level instead becomes a pretty linear affair due to what I
                        assume is a mistake in design: I do not think the one way in the first red path was intentional-
                        your reward for taking the red path from the top of the white path results in absolutely
                        nothing. My current theory is they forgot to place a spring to ascend that small cliff. I have
                        my best gaming mystery investigator on the case right now. Discord user Calm Ronald Calmly
                        booted up the game and managed to just barely be able ascend past the wall, but it would be
                        unreasonable to expect most players to be able to do that.
                        <br><br>
                        This level also requires rolling up the giant half pipe at the middle to progress- the game can
                        now feel like it can ask some skilled players to utilize the rolling mechanics casually. I
                        imagine the next zone will feature these ramps prominently.
                        <br><br>
                        Looking at this last simplified map confirms it: you mostly have linear lines with these small
                        bursts of path choices. It isn’t linear per se, but it *is* simple when you look at the basic
                        pathing!

                <p>I will explain the green line. You press a switch, avoiding a rising platform that is your only
                        ticket back up. A new platform appears, which will take you across the lake to a shortcut to the
                        end. In a way, this elevates the level further than the Marble Zones. Perhaps.
                        <br><br>
                        As you can see below, the green shortcut is the only thing preventing Act 1 from being the
                        simplest path map in the game. Honestly, the simplification does it more favors than it
                        deserves.

                        <br><br>
                        There is also nothing in it. Waste o time! I’m dead serious, if it wasn’t for the gravity
                        section the map would be a literal hallway from beginning to end.

                <p> This the first level that vertically scrolls- IE: the top wraps around the bottom. You can see this
                        happen only in the water slide at the start. You are forced to find the switch to escape
                        slipping slide purgatory, which unlocks the only mandatory green path in the game.
                        <br><br>
                        Honestly! This level is full of good ideas! It is the only good level in this entire zone! It
                        tries to match the namesake of being a labyrinth, with all sorts of secret paths. Later Sonic
                        games go out of their way to revisit this exploratory structure- tbh, if you where to add one
                        more fork on the blue path and add like 3 different red paths, ACT 3 serves as a template for
                        future Sonic levels.
                        <br><br>
                        Structurally, this also bears a striking resemblance to Marble Zone act 3, with its winding
                        platforming structure to top the level off. From here on out, nearly every level will feature
                        winding platforming section on the main path- It slipped my mind that this level tries to find a
                        safe (albeit frustrating) way to ease you into this structure.
                        <br><br>
                        See, people hate this act, but it atleast *resembles* some of the more complex design offered in
                        other zones, while also offering some unique ideas regarding level structure! In case it wasn’t
                        clear, the S is where you start.

                <img onclick="window.open(this.src, '_blank');" src="images/articles/6-sonic/Starlight.png" />
                <p>You have to trudge through 2 boring zones and 1 tutorial zone to get here, but Starlight Zone is the
                        designed realization of Sonic 1’s level and movement design. It is tempting to say that it’s the
                        blueprint of all future sonic games but: It isn’t. It’s clear the designers thought that giving
                        players TOO MANY path choices could lead to aimlessly wandering a level without a feeling of
                        progress (or worse, literally getting lost)- Every stage has atleast 15 one way obstacles to
                        keep the player moving forward. How on earth do they accomplish this? Two ways:
                        <br><br>
                        <b>1. THE FANS.</b> These things blow against Sonic with enough strength to prevent passage,
                        even with jumping. They also push the player through them if approached from the other end,
                        ensuring a player is quickly locked into a path of their choosing (willful or not).
                        <br><br>
                        <b>2. STAIR CASE BLOCKS.</b> There are two variants: one you walk on to, and one you have to
                        jump into from below. Doing the correct action will lower the horizontal line of blocks into a
                        staircase, allowing the player to climb them while often blocking off another path entirely.
                        <br><br>
                        I have been abstaining from overexplaining Sonic 1’s Mechanics, but I figured nobody would
                        believe me that the next level had <i>*sixteen*</i> one-way paths without me offering a tiny
                        explanation.
                        <br><br>
                        Not to mention, many players do not make it this far. I can’t honestly blame them- they really
                        should have deleted Marble Zone and make Labyrinth Zone an actual maze. Maybe they could add a
                        few more weirder, interesting zones that play with open spaces. Maybe they could do time travel
                        as well? Who knows! Too bad nobody made a game like that.
                        <br><br>
                        One more thing: You may notice a lack of checkpoints in the next 3 levels. No, I did not forget
                        to mark them- there really are no checkpoints. I will explain momentarily.
                </p>

                <h3>Starlight Zone: ACT 1</h3>
                <img onclick="window.open(this.src, '_blank');" src="images/articles/6-sonic/SLZ1_Lines.png" />
                <p>This level has 16 one ways. There is nothing further to tutorialize, so the game gets out of the way
                        to drop the best levels it has to offer. Interestingly, there are many blue paths on the first
                        red path, including a red path that requires 3 different skillful ascensions to enter.
                        <br><br>
                        Some of these blue paths are entered by interacting with the staircase platforms that must be
                        activated manually. They are a bit finnicky and can be breezed by, so they definitely count as a
                        secret.
                        <br><br>
                        The white path also uniquely hugs the bottom and is the hardest path. I’m certain this is the
                        reason for having no checkpoints: they want you to keep getting sent down different paths
                        whenever you die! rewards are carefully thought out and chances are you approach this stage in a
                        million different ways. Most likely, you won’t see the winding platforming section at the end.
                        <br><br>
                        The isolated white section is interesting: it is yet another puzzle section. You have to
                        successfully roll through the steep half pipe in order to not fall back to the beginning of the
                        loop. I had to color this section white because both a blue and red section join up to this
                        loop- unless you take the top or bottom most routes, this serves as the final section of the
                        level. Looks like Labyrinth Zone WAS trying to teach you something structurally!
                        <br><br>
                        I will admit: my simplification system breaks when you bunch together too many one way
                        obstacles, but perhaps that should tell you they went overboard! As an exercise, feel free to
                        edit the map to try and push the player forward while using HALF as many one way doors. I
                        promise it is possible, and you just have to accept some possibility for players to enter into
                        loops. Just make sure they’re small ones! (NOTE: The lowest I was happy with was 9. This is
                        close to half, but not quite. I want you to outdo me! Or don’t, we have more to talk about!)

                <p>This stage is one for the books- it has the most loops in the entire game. Interestingly, the path of
                        least resistance (holding right mostly) hugs the TOP of the stage and is an even-tempered
                        affair. It splits into two equal paths that pick a slightly different flavor of fun for a smooth
                        experience. Players who enter the ending section of the level from the top will have the safest
                        time traversing the ending section- a fall merely means the player falls to a lower path. I call
                        this section “the Teeter Totter Gauntlet”
                        <br><br>
                        The bottom half of the level is entered through a crumbling floor- It isn’t a secret, but it is
                        a path that must be opted into over holding right. In addition, the “silly fan” will throw a
                        curious player right into the pit they just opened. They look like a regular, one-way wall fan,
                        but instead they violently throw you backwards.
                        <br><br>
                        The alternate path is more fun, with its extreme rolling heights and loops giving you enough
                        speed to escape the game camera. Successfully staying on the red paths (the second one is a
                        surprisingly hard jump to make!) will reward you by placing you at the top of the Teeter Totter
                        Gauntlet.
                        <br><br>
                        There are still no checkpoints, and players (mostly those who take the blue path) DEFINITELY die
                        in the Teeter Gauntlet often enough to require a restart. Every restart is an opportunity to
                        take a different path!
                        <br><br>
                        Again- too many one-ways for my personal liking, but ultimately they work as far as preventing
                        the player from attempting to navigate this space like a maze. I find it interesting how even in
                        the simplified map, the Teeter Gauntlet is identifiably different than the rest of the level.
                        The first half of the level has very little path lockout as well- it’s overall a pretty
                        straightforward level in comparison to the other acts!

                <p>21 One ways. This stage opens with a BIG chamber with 2 different exits. The level starts bifurcated,
                        but quickly starts locking you into different paths, with plenty of choices to send you into
                        another path- taking the blue path results in no fewer than 2 intersections you can meaningfully
                        take. The main path presents you with 6 meaningful path choices, which is more than any other
                        level in the game by my count so far. It is an amazingly complex stage, and its clear the level
                        designers were terrified of it- hence the abundance of one way paths.
                        <br><br>
                        There are still no checkpoints! The lower routes still contain the most likely deaths, but
                        overall any path that isn’t the lowest path will expose you to Sonic 1’s finest level geometry.
                        If you take the highest path, you go through more loops than any single path you can take on the
                        game! It’s a very memorable map with memorable set pieces- it’s almost designed like a house
                        with rooms!
                        <br><br>
                        Simply look at the simplified map. Pure bliss. While I try and sperate sections coherent
                        circles, this is the only one I can justify as true, singularly contained hoop with concentric
                        loops and byways. It’s beautiful. It’s a football, and I chiseled it.

                <h2>Scrap Brain Zone</h2>
                <p>It’s all downhill from here! Figuratively, unfortunately- Scrap brain features nearly no ramps and
                        few slopes, instead favoring general platforming tests. It is mostly bad. Perhaps the paths are
                        interesting? Let’s find out!</p>

                <h3>Scrap Brain Zone: ACT 1</h3>
                <img onclick="window.open(this.src, '_blank');" src="images/articles/6-sonic/SBZ1_Lines.png" />
                <p>This almost looks like a good level but look very closely at where the checkpoint is. When you take
                        it, you are locked out of exploring other options! In particular, if you fail the red path at
                        the first juncture, you are actively barred from trying it again until you game over. The blue
                        path (the hardest one with the most instant death hazards) has absolutely no checkpoint at all!
                        It means that most people’s trek through this level is monolithic- fumble through the center
                        path until the stage is over. If you manage to keep on the one red path, you skip on
                        particularly mean death pit area.
                        <br><br>
                        This isn’t inherently bad! After all, players are least likely to repeat the final levels due to
                        a game over, since they’re the end of the game. However, the stage itself mainly consists of
                        pure, methodical platforming and avoiding hazards. Players who favor taking the higher red paths
                        ARE rewarded with more of what they like, but the main path leaves a lot to be desired. The
                        death pit at the end of the main path feels particularly a cruel invention. I’d accuse of
                        swallowing quarters if it wasn’t on the genesis.
                        <br><br>
                        Please note that the simplification makes the stage look bigger than it is- the second red path
                        is actually much smaller and closer to the bottom-main path.

                <p>Perhaps you’re confused- this level is another vertically wrapping levels, like Labyrinth Zone Act 3.
                        It looks mind bogglingly complex, dare I say interesting, when observed without notes or edits.
                        I have done the hard work of simplifying the level for you, without having to think of sonic
                        warping from the top of the screen to the bottom. I have (mostly) eliminated duplicate geometry
                        for clarity. This was super easy because the level is extremely simple. You have 2 paths: a main
                        one and a red one. The main path has a secret, hidden path you can take (more on that later)
                        that simply skips the hardest part of the main path. At no point do the paths meaningfully
                        interesect.

                        I’ll be honest: I’m not sure why this level needed to be this complex. You don’t feel that
                        complexity when navigating it. Because paths never meaningfully connect to each other (until the
                        end), you will probably never be clued into how the space does (and doesn’t) connect to itself.
                        No matter how you shake it, you are simply avoiding things in a hallway. Is it maybe thematic of
                        the threat Robotnik’s developed plans for the world? Perhaps!
                        <br><br>
                        Is it good?
                        <br><br>
                        About that green path: the teleporter will drop you off at a different station if you have more
                        than 50 rings. I’m dead serious, I had to look it up. Nothing else in the game works like that.
                        <br><br>
                        Before you ask, the vertical scrolling results in exactly ONE impossible space- the winding
                        staircase section copied from Act 1. for simplicities sake:

                <p>Leave this stage alone- it’s a good stage! I’m serious! The checkpoint placement isn’t too bad, and
                        it’s a short enough length to justify its more funnily existence. I feel like this level SHOULD
                        have replaced one of Labyrinth zones acts, and it would have been fine. It even has a
                        nonstandard entrance and exit!
                        <br><br>
                        Again: I don’t think a level has to have branching paths to be good, and all things considered
                        the main path is still fairly linear- but the mechanics it asks you to engage with are
                        reasonable and don’t waste your time. No slow weird switch puzzles- just meaningful use of the
                        water physics! Sure, later sonic games do it way better, but this stage is distinct in a way
                        that is interesting. It has the most aggressive shortcut of every level in the game!

                        the future games. While I don’t particularly believe in the objective critique, when I do any
                        sort of serious analysis I try to completely abstain where I can. I never succeed, but I do hope
                        I haven’t misconstrued any of the insights regarding Sonic 1’s pathing- I like to think the devs
                        were trying to build the bridge while driving over it. There is a reason the sequels Immediately
                        become increasingly complex affairs in regards to pathing!
